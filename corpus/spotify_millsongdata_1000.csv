Nirvana,Polly,"Polly wants a cracker  
I think I should get off her first  
I think she wants some water  
To put out the blow torch  
  
It isn't me  
We have some seed  
Let me clip  
Your dirty wings  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
I've got some rope  
You have been told  
I promise you  
I have been true  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
  
Polly wants a cracker  
Maybe she would like some food  
She asks me to untie her  
A chase would be nice for a few  
  
It isn't me  
We have some seed  
Let me clip  
Your dirty wings  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
I've got some rope  
You have been told  
I promise you  
I have been true  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
  
Polly said  
  
Polly says her back hurts  
And she's just as bored as me  
She caught me off my guard  
It amazes me, the will of instinct  
  
It isn't me  
We have some seed  
Let me clip  
Your dirty wings  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
I've got some rope  
You have been told  
I promise you  
I have been true  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself

Beautiful South,"You Play Glockenspiel, I'll Play Drums","There's a boy with a brace across his teeth  
White socks, tattooed underneath  
Bus tickets chitched up in his palm  
Stood there he's spinning a yarn  
There's a girl with a plastic pair of shoes  
Two eyes permanently bruised  
Can't find the time to be alarmed  
Just stood spinning a yarn  
Just take your time  
It'll work out fine  
It'll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums  
My name is Derek from the den  
I deal in shillings and in pence  
I'll get you any deal you like  
Ten sweets for a mountain bike you like  
My name is Mandy from the yard  
I deal in crazy tarot cards  
I'll tell you what the future brings  
One cat and a dog that sings  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums  
Just take your time  
It'll work out fine  
It'll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums

Delete me from your friends,  
I don't care what you think,  
Let's forget we ever met,  
Don't cha worry 'bout me,  
  
So I'm sick to my stomach,  
When I'm think about the wasted time we spend togeth,  
Planning on forever,  
(Whatever)  
  
Cheat me once, shame on you,  
Cheat me twice, shame on me  
I'm an idiot,

That beautiful face  
Or these warm or worse days

I could never go back

That you're living in the past  
  
And if you'd ever believe  
I would take you back,  
It took you long to get in  
But now you're out so fast  
  
The way you played your cards  
Shoulda told me who you are  
Always goin' all in  
And you hated when I win  
  
Just had me whipped too far  
I shoulda known from the start  
That you gamble,

Ooooh, there's something better out there  
Ooooh, Hello to the new me  
Ooooh So goodbye baby,

Ray Charles,Carry Me Back To Old Virginny,"Carry me back to old Virginny,  
There's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow,  
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,  
There's where the darkey's heart am longed to go.  
  
There's where I labored so hard for old massa,  
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,  
No place on earth do I love more sincerely,  
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born.  
  
Carry me back to old Virginny,  
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,  
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,  
There's where this old darkies' life am passed away.  
  
Massa and misses, have long gone before me,  
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore.  
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,  
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.  
  
Carry me back to old Virginny,  
There's where the cotton and the corn and tators grow,  
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,  
There's where the old darkies' heart am longed to go.

U2,Fast Cars,"My cell is ringing  
No ID  
I need to know who's calling  
  
My garden's overgrown  
I go out on my belly crawling  
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC  
I got the nightly news  
To get to know the enemy  
  
All I want is a picture of you  
All I want is to get right next to you  
All I want is your face in a locket  
Picture in my pocket  
I take a pill to stop it  
  
I know these fast cars  
Will do me no good  
  
I'm going nowhere  
Where I am it is a lot of fun  
There in the desert to dismantle an atomic bomb  
I watch you shadow box  
Check the stocks  
I'm in detox  
I want the lot of what you've got  
What you've got can make this stop  
  
All I want is a picture of you  
All I want is to get right next to you  
All I want is your picture in a locket  
Your face in my pocket  
Take a pill to stop it  
  
I know these fast cars  
Will do me no good  
  
Child inside  
  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
  
You should worry 'bout the day  
That the pain it goes away  
You know I miss mine sometimes  
  
The size is much too big  
  
There is no fiction  
That will truly fit the situation  
I'm documenting every detail  
Every conversation  
Not used to talkin' to somebody in the body  
Somebody in a body,  
Somebody in a body

Norah Jones,4 Broken Hearts,"Ooh, ooh ooh  
  
People can't be hand-made  
But he keeps slaving away  
At a stone that's too hard to break  
A girl who's too lost to save  
  
So you tried to replace me  
But you didn't get far  
And I tried to repay you  
But I only got scarred  
  
Ooh, ooh ooh  
  
She'll be breaking your fall  
And I'll be building new walls  
But this time I'll have to make sure  
To add a window for you to come back  
  
And we tried to be faithful  
But didn't get far  
Now all we'll be left with is four broken hearts  
I tried to erase you  
But didn't get get far enough away from you  
Because you still can break my heart  
  
Ooh, ooh ooh  
Ooh, ooh ooh  
Ooh, ooh ooh

Johnny Cash,Blistered,"I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot  
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead  
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city  
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed  
  
he's got a whole lotta motion in her sole, I know  
But her sole ain't the place she lets it show  
  
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah  
Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah  
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart  
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go  
  
I've got great big blisters on my fingertips  
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills  
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat  
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills  
  
And ever since she started running around from bar to bar  
I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down  
  
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah  
She done got me, oh yeah  
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart  
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go  
  
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah  
Oh I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

The White Stripes,Party Of Special Things To Do,"When the stiff wind blows  
The flag don't wiggle  
In the party of special things to do  
I met the ace of love  
She took me to her plantation  
For the love without separation  
In the party of special things to do  
It could happen to me  
It could happen to you  
I met the ace of love  
She said I want you to go  
To the party of special things to do  
And when you're through  
I'll be right here waiting for you  
Here take these sparks  
So my distant cousins can get along with you  
Watch out for the mirror man  
And Elixir Sue  
When I got to the party of special things to do  
It wasn't hard to find Elixir Sue  
I met all the cards  
The wild cards  
The one-eye Jill  
The red queen  
She turned her head  
You know what I mean  
She turned it back and said  
""I got a brand new game I want to lay on you""  
I met them all  
At the party of special things to do  
When I was done  
I was far from through  
I returned to the ace of love  
Now wouldn't you?  
I met them all  
The camel wore a nightie  
The camel wore a nightie  
At the party of special things to do  
Elixir Sue  
It wasn't hard to find liquor at the do  
I met all the cards  
The wild cards  
You know what I mean  
Then she turned it back and said  
""I got a brand new game I think I want to lay on you""  
I met elixir Sue  
At the party of special things to do  
It's so special

Marianne Faithfull,Ghost Dance,"What is it children that falls from the sky?  
Tayi, taya, tayi, aye ya.  
Mannah from Heaven from most high,  
Food from the Father, tayi, taye ya.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the grief.  
  
Peace to your brother, give and take heed,

One foot extended, snake to the ground,  
Wave of the Earth, one turn around.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again,shake out the grief, babe.  
  
Stretch out your arms now dip and sway,  
Fruit of thy bird, tayi, taya.  
Threw off your shoe, haul off the sow,  
Dust off the words that shape from the tale.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.

Bread of your bread, host of your host.  
We are the tears that fall from your eyes,  
Word of your word, cry of your cry.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again.  
We shall live again, we shall live.  
  
What is it, Father, in your eye,  
What is this grave sign, eyes to cry.  
Blood of my baby, well, just what I need.  
What is it, hide me, way off to speed.  
  
Who is it, Father, holy that night?  
What is it, Father, that moves to the right?  
What is it, Father, isn't it pain?  
What is it, Father, that shapes from your main?  
  
What is it, Father, supposed to be brave?  
A lot of questions, the right to live  
What is it, baby, I can't do.  
Your mama loves you, I'm dying, too.  
  
I won't forget you, never lie  
I'll always love you till I die

Through another day  
Watching my dreams  
Turn into ashes  
And my hopes  
Into bits of clay  
Once I could see  
Once I could feel

Oh without a goal  
Stripped of my heart  
And my soul  
What now, my love  
Now that it's over

Closing in on me  
Here come the stars  
Tumbling around me  
And there's the sky  
Where the sea should be  
What now, my love  
Now that you're gone  
I'd be a fool  
To go on and on  
No one would care  
No one would cry  
If I should live  
If I should die  
What now, my love  
Now there is nothing  
Only my last goodbye  
Only my last  
My last goodbye

I saw violence in the moon  
Two broken lovers strong and strewn,  
I drank myself into a dream:  
  
Tijuana moon,  
My daddy Tijuana moon,  
Oh my darlin',  
Tijuana moon Lord my daddy  
Tijuana moon  
  
You can keep the Texas blues,  
Tequila and the burning stone,  
But my amigo  
Nothin's good against the Tijuana moon  
  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon  
Talk about lovin' Tijuana moon  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon

David Bowie,Almost Grown,"Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school  
They ain't said I broke no rule  
I ain't never been in Dutch  
I don't browse around too much  
Don't bother me, leave me alone  
Anyway I'm almost grown  
I don't run around with no mob  
Got myself a little job  
I'm gonna buy me a little car  
Drive my girl in the park  
Got my eye on a little girl  
Ah, she's really out of this world  
When I take her to the dance  
She's got to talk about romance  
You know I'm still livin' in town  
But I done married and settled down  
Now I really have a ball  
So I don't browse around at all

James Taylor,Riding On A Railroad,"We are riding on a railroad, singing some else's song  
Forever standing by the cross road.  
Take a side and step along.  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea.  
Maybe you an me can meet again.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing someone else's song  
Sing along.  
Time to time I tire of the life that I've been leading  
Town to town, day by day  
There's a man up here who claims to have his hands upon the reins.  
There are chains upon his hands and he's riding upon a train.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing some else's song  
Forever standing by the cross road.  
Take a side and step along.  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea.  
Maybe you an me can meet again.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing someone else's song.

Perry Como,Just One Way To Say I Love You,"I love you, I love you, there's no other way  
Just one way to say ""I love you""  
I love you, I love you, and, try as I may  
That's all I can say - ""I love you""  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you, I love you, and yearn for the day  
The day when you'll say ""I love you""  
  
There's no other way  
Just one way to say ""I love you""

Dream Theater,Lines In The Sand,"Sometimes  
For a moment of bliss  
In the passion  
We're craving  
There's a message we miss  
  
Sometimes when  
The spirit's left alone  
We must believe in something  
To find if we've grown  
  
Tragic reflex  
Shattered calm  
Static progress  
Senses gone  
Numb awareness

If you're perfectly still  
You can hear the virgin weeping  
For the savior of your will  
  
Sometimes  
Your castles in the air  
And the fantasies you're seeking  
Are the crosses you bear  
  
Sacred conflict  
Blessed prize  
Weeping crosses  
Stainless eyes  
Desperate addict

We fabricate our demons  
Invite them into our homes  
Have supper with the aliens  
And fight the war alone  
We conjure up our skeletons  
Enlist the den of thieves  
Frightened from our closets  
Then sewn upon our sleeves  
  
In the stream of consciousness  
There is a river crying  
Living comes much easier  
Once we admit  
We're dying  
  
Sometimes  
In the wreckage of our wake  
There's a bitterness we harbor  
And hate for hatred's sake  
  
Sometimes  
We dig an early grave  
And crucify our instincts  
For the hope we couldn't save  
  
Sometimes  
A view from sinless eyes  
Centers our perspective  
And pacifies our cries  
  
Sometimes  
The anguish we survive  
And the mysteries we nurture  
Are the fabrics of our lives  
  
Swept away with the tide

Electric Light Orchestra,Need Her Love,"She gives me love that I could never hope to have,  
She tells me that she needs me,she tells me that she's glad,  
And if she goes away, I'm like someone who's left out in the rain,  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
She came in from the west, a summer breeze I couldn't rest,  
I had to take a fast train, to be there by her side,  
She made me feel so good, she made it like it should be all the time  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
Just when I was thinkin' of her, she came along and made me  
want her. I need her love, I need her love, I need her love.  
  
If she goes away, I'm like someone who's left out in the rain,  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
The boats that sail, the planes that fly,she is with me.  
I wonder if she wonders, if this is all for real,  
I couldn't stand to see her cry because of me, that would be sad.  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
She tells me everything, she makes me smile, she tries to sing,  
But never shares her suffering, if things are going wrong,  
She makes it like a dream, if things are as they seem the  
world is good. I need her love, I need her love, I need her love.

I saw it in her eyes  
She'd be gone before the evening  
  
So I poured another strong one  
And chopped a line from here to Texas  
'Cause I've lost another good one  
She's on the midnight train to Memphis  
  
With a brand new start  
I swore I'd love from the heart  
I meant to change my ways  
But I've seen better days  
  
Than the one that's here this morning, mmhm  
With a wife and kids at home  
With a job somewhere on some assembly line  
I wish I had that life  
I bet you wish you had mine

I'm improving the conditions of the rap industry  
The beat will expand, to land on foreign lands  
Germany, Italy, France and Japan, it'll  
Give you a lift, no need to sniff  
No butts no how's no why's or if's  
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated  
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it  
Wrapped by a power, a musical shower-shower  
A picture-picture of me-of me on the Eiffel-Eiffel Tower-Tower  
I need a beat-beat  
  
Doing-doing dirty, I'm your-your thought  
You're bein'-being taken-taken, the musical boom  
I'm in full treating your eardrums  
Increasing the rate of vibration  
I wanna rock ya-rock ya, that's all you need to know-know  
I need a beat, is the title of the show-show  
Providing-providing pleasure on the musical measures  
All-all arranged, to alleviate pressure  
I'm up on your list, your party thera-therapist  
Beat programmer and lyri-lyricist  
Ladies Love Cool James, studio user  
A million or more screaming people abuser  
I predict, this jam will hit  
The highest plateau in the world of music  
Paparazzi, wealth and fame  
The total propulsion, of my name  
  
I need a beat  
  
Computer wise, and the engineer's eyes  
Have to be very acute, education level high  
The product is mine, beat on the rhyme  
The control was part of the studio design  
Track after track, culminating on wax  
The tape has slack, rewind then back  
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel  
A perfect place for MC's to duel  
  
I need a beat, Farmer's Boulevard  
Ha ha, Queens! Ladies Love Cool James!  
Cut Creator!

Venom,Satanachist,"I preach the ways of Satan  
Answer to his calls  
I translate manuscripts  
On ancient Latin scrolls  
In my shrine, my avernus  
I see the gates of Hell  
Guarded well by Chronozon  
Tortured souls do dwell  
Satanachist  
Satanachist  
I mount the virgin Venus  
Plague the blackened seas  
I am the souls destructor  
Marching without fear  
The night is filled with souls  
In coral exctasy  
The saraband of death  
Will always follow me  
Satanachist  
Satanachist  
I bear the evil eye  
Possess the unbidden  
I'll bring your dead alive  
And chew your flesh from bone  
I stalk through life and death  
With Gorgon for my gaze  
I breath the immortal pain  
Beware the human race

Amy Grant,It's A Miracle,"It must have happened sometime in the night  
No one saw the stone be rolled away  
When the grave saw morning light  
The skeptics and friends all had to say  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
My soul is like a tomb in constant night  
Till one day the stone was rolled away  
Then my heart saw morning light  
And no one alive can explain it away  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
Now, now won't you see  
What I'm trying to say?  
If you believe, it could happen today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
It's a miracle, what a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, what a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away

You know it's really a miracle  
A miracle, a miracle

You know it's really a miracle

Michael W. Smith,Let It Rain,"Let it rain, let it rain.  
Open the floodgates of heaven  
Repeat  
  
The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad  
Let the distance shores rejoice  
Clouds and thick darkness surround Him  
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne  
A fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side  
His lightning lights up the world  
The earth sees and trembles  
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord  
Before the Lord of all the earth  
The heavens proclaim His righteousness  
And all peoples will see His glory  
  
We want to see Your glory, God!  
Do you want to see His glory?  
Lift your voices, lift your hands!  
  
Let it rain, let it rain.  
Open the floodgates of heaven  
Let it rain, let it rain.  
Open the floodgates of heaven

America,What Does It Matter,"(Great hits of the sixties)  
Look the lady's got a photograph  
Silver framed and velvet backed  
Well, she took it quite a while ago  
Funny that she never let me know  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesn't show  
I just don't know  
It's only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh, oh, oh  
And now she's wearing satin shoes  
Gilded hair to pay the dues  
I guess that I should tip my hat  
I wonder if she'd think of looking back  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesn't show  
I just don't know  
It's only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh, oh  
In the parking lot late at night  
Paper straws never worked out right  
I knew I wanted to  
But didn't know why  
So I just said ""Hi""  
(Everybody sing along now)

Bee Gees,Don't Throw It All Away,"Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why  
But lately you don't talk to me  
Darling I can't see me in your eyes  
I hold you near but you're so far away  
And it's losing you I can't believe  
To watch you leave and let this feeling die  
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive  
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love  
You know I can't survive  
Only my love can raise you high above it all  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
(break)  
  
We can take the darkness and make if full of light  
But let your love flow back to me  
How can you leave and let this feeling die  
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone  
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on  
No other women's love could be as true, I'm begging you  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
We changed the world we made it ours to hold  
But dreams are made for those who really try  
This losing you is real  
But I still feel you here inside  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love

Joni Mitchell,Turbulent Indigo,"You want to make Van Goghs  
Raise 'em up like sheep  
Make 'em out of Eskimos  
And women if you please  
Make 'em nice and normal  
Make 'em nice and neat  
You see him with his shotgun there?  
Bloodied in the wheat?  
Oh what do you know about  
Living in Turbulent Indigo?  
  
Brash fields, crude crows  
In a scary sky  
In a golden frame  
Roped off  
Tourists guided by  
Tourists talking about the madhouse  
Talking about the ear  
The madman hangs in fancy homes  
They wouldn't let him near!  
He'd piss in their fireplace!  
He'd drag them through Turbulent Indigo  
  
""I'm a burning hearth,"" he said  
""People see the smoke  
But no one comes to warm themselves  
Sloughing off a coat  
And all my little landscapes  
All my yellow afternoons  
Stack up around this vacancy  
Like dirty cups and spoons  
No mercy Sweet Jesus!  
No mercy from Turbulent Indigo.""

Look at that Ganja covered with oil  
Using my tweezers, Got pot in the freezer  
Made a new pipe out of aluminium foil  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
(On a rope On a rope On a rope)  
Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
Don't know the reason, Satyed here all season  
Maybe that Tye-stick was a way bit too strong  
But I got a real beauty, A columbian doobie  
And soon I'll be up on my way along  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope

Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
I blew out my bong pipe, Ran out of budlight  
But I found some stash I had hidden at home  
Put it into a blender, And soon it will render  
These little fudge brownies that help me get stoned

Hillsong,I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever,"[Intro:]  
Over the mountains and the sea  
Your river runs with love for me  
And I will open up my heart  
And let the Healer set me free  
I'm happy to be in the truth  
And I will daily lift my hands  
For I will always sing of  
Of when Your love came down  
  
[Chorus:]  
I could sing of Your love forever (x4)  
  
[Bridge:]  
Oh I feel like dancing  
It's foolishness I know  
But when the world has seen the light  
They will dance with joy  
Like we're dancing now  
  
I could sing of your love forever (5x)

Conway Twitty,Goodbye Time,"Goodbye Time  
It's your life  
You say you need a change  
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true  
  
Mean anything  
You say it's different now  
And you keep staring at the door  
How can you walk away  
Don't I matter anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
If being free  
Is worth what you leave behind  
And if it's too late  
For love to change your mind  
Then it's goodbye time  
  
If we had known  
Our love would come to this  
We could have saved our hearts  
The hurt of wasted years  
  
Well it's been fun  
What else can I say  
If the feeling's gone  
Words won't stop you anyway

And she's been sitting in the lobby since nine  
  
She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves

And time can move so slow  
When you're all dressed up

Leaving with their families  
The nurse tells her, it's time to come to dinner  
She says she's expecting company  
They're just running late  
But, the nurse knows the truth too well  
She just sighs and walks away

Yusuf Islam,I Think I See The Light,"I used to trust nobody  
Trusting even less their words  
Until I found somebody  
There was no one I preferred  
  
My heart was made of stone  
My eyes saw only misty gray  
Until you came into my life  
I saw everyone that way  
  
Until I found the one  
I needed at my side  
I think I would have been  
A blind man all my life  
  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
  
I used to walk alone  
Every step seemed the same  
This world was not my home  
So there was nothing much to gain  
  
Look up and see the clouds  
Look down and see the cold floor  
Until you came into my life  
I saw nothing, nothing more  
  
Until I found the one  
I needed at my side  
I think I would have been  
A blind man all my life  
  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
(Shine, shine, shine)  
I think I see the light  
(Shine, shine, shine)  
  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
So shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
  
I think I see the light  
Coming to me, coming through me  
Giving me a second sight  
  
So shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
  
Shine, shine, shine  
(I think I see the light)  
Shine, shine, shine

Shine, shine, shine

A smoking gun  
Frozen wasteland we are on  
I see the lights  
Flames ignite  
Cigarettes that I don't own  
I've seen them bleed  
Watched them beg  
Walked to where the sidewalk ends  
Recycled bars, brand new cars  
Better find that cabby quick

Dim the lights  
The city ignites  
Silent boycott of our lives  
We are the town  
The time is now  
Got one chance to paint it red  
  
Every night, start a fight  
Find a count to make it right  
Take a shot, make it grip  
Gonna shoot one from the hip  
  
Drinks for free when you're with me  
If you're down with me  
Then you must believe  
  
Believe  
That you're always on my mind

Don't ask me for a reason, I can't explain  
Why we hurt one another again and again  
As I lie bleeding here I still

And I just can't watch it slipping away  
And I just can't let it go  
And I just can't stand another minute  
  
Maybe now someday our shattered live  
Will mend themselves again  
But now a million miles away

Why we hurt one another again and again

Sting,A Thousand Years,"A thousand years, a thousand more  
A thousand times a million doors to eternity  
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times  
An endless turning stairway climbs  
To a tower of souls  
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,  
The towers rise to numberless floors in space  
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,  
A million names but only one truth to face  
A million roads, a million fears  
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty  
I could speak a million lies, a million songs,  
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time  
But if there was a single truth, a single light  
A single thought, a singular touch of grace  
Then following this single point, this single flame,  
This single haunted memory of your face  
I still love you  
I still want you  
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves  
Like galaxies in my head  
I may be numberless, I may be innocent  
I may know many things, I may be ignorant  
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands  
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands  
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times  
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes  
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief  
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief  
I still love you  
I still want you  
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves  
Like galaxies in my head  
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves  
Eternities still unsaid  
'Til you love me

Alison Krauss,This Time The Dream's On Me,"Somewhere, someday we'll be close together  
Wait and see  
Oh, by the way  
This time the dream's on me  
  
You'll take my hand  
And you'll look at me adoringly  
But as things stand  
This time the dream's on me

It would be fun  
To be certain that I'm the one  
To know that I, at least  
Supply the shoulder you cry upon  
  
To see you through  
Till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true but  
This time the dream's on me

To see you through  
Till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true but

Proclaimers,When You're In Love,"When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind  
  
Seeing things like your heart with wings  
Then you hear violin strings playing  
Feel all the things that you feel you should  
You would lie, you would kill, you would die  
At least that's what you're saying  
The worst thing is that you really would  
  
When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind  
  
Six thousand million people in the world  
And you say there's just one  
The only one, and you must be together  
And if they love you the pain is so sweet  
And it just gets better and better  
And if they don't  
You want them more than ever  
  
When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind

Barbra Streisand,A Taste Of Honey,"Cold winds may blow o'er the icy sea  
But I'll take with me  
The warmth of thee  
A taste of honey,  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
He will return...he will return  
He'll come back  
For the honey and me  
I leave behind  
My heart to wear  
And may it e'er remind you of  
A taste of honey  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
He will return...he will return...  
He'll come back for the honey and me.

The Jam,To Be Someone,"To be someone must be a wonderful thing  
A famous footballer a rock singer  
Or a big film star, yes I think I would like that  
To be rich and have lots of fans  
Have lots of girls to prove that I'm a man  
And be no. 1 - and liked by everyone  
  
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends  
They really dig me and I dig them  
And the bread I spend - is like my fame - its quickly diminished  
  
And there's no more swimming in a guitar shaped pool  
No more reporters at my beck and call  
No more cocaine its only ground chalk  
No more taxis now well have to walk  
  
But didn't we have a nice time -  
didn't we have a nice time  
Oh wasn't it such a fine time  
  
I realize I should have stuck to my guns  
Instead shit out to be one of the bastard sons  
And lose myself - I know it was wrong - but its cost me a lot  
  
And there's no more drinking after the club shuts down,  
I'm out on me arse with the rest of the clowns  
Its really frightening without a bodyguard  
So I stay confined to my lonely room

Oasis,Underneath The Sky,"Underneath the sky of red  
Is a storyteller sleeping alone  
He has no face and he has no name  
And his whereabouts are sort of unknown  
  
All he needs is his life in a suitcase  
It belongs to a friend of a friend's  
And as we drink to ourselves  
We'll amuse ourselves  
Underneath the sky  
Underneath the sky again  
Underneath the sky again  
  
So wish me away to an unknown place  
Am I living in a land with no name  
I'll be making a start with my brand new heart  
Stop me making sense once again  
  
All we need is our lives in a suitcase  
They belong to a friend of a friend's  
And as we drink to ourselves  
We'll amuse ourselves

Uriah Heep,Mistress Of All Time,"(enlightened woman)  
She dances on the seven seas  
Dances on the ocean  
Sunlight on her golden hair  
Shapes of pure emotion  
Her voice is heard like  
Crystal words across the sky  
She moves just like an angel  
She's the mistress of all time  
Her sun pours down like liquid gold  
To chase away the sorrows  
Her clothes are like a million stars  
Made of tears and rainbows  
And all the while  
Her senses smile into my life  
She moves just like an angel  
She's a mistress of all time  
Just like the restless  
To a mission bell  
I must run to her  
Meet her everywhere  
As her music fills the universe  
She leaves the dancing visions  
Of her image on the water  
And precious stones upon the shore  
From every distant corner  
Like diamonds in the light  
They shine beyond the stars  
She moves just like an angel  
She's the mistress of all time  
She dances on the seven seas  
Dances on the ocean  
Sunlight on her golden hair  
Shapes of pure emotion  
Her voice is heard like  
Crystal words across the sky  
She moves me like an angel  
She's the mistress of all time  
She moves me like an angel  
A voice of pure emotion  
Her tears are like a rainbow

But I do believe in Christmas  
  
Walking through a winter dreamland  
Sleighbells ringing and my friends by my side

The reindeer is singing our favourite song  
And Santa's coming to our party  
Dancing all night long  
  
Cause I believe in Christmas  
I believe in dreams come true  
When it's cold outside  
I close my eyes  
And it's magic through and through  
I believe in Christmas  
I believe in Santa's gifts

The angels sing  
And Christmas time is here  
For you and for me  
  
The stars are shining oh so brightly  
The snowman's hopping and bopping with me  
Lots of joy for everybody  
Under the Christmas tree  
Everyone is so excited  
You know it's just how I want it to be  
I'm hoping that all my wishful thinking  
Will be reality

Life to day moves with the tide  
Stormy seas, harbor of light

Run away with any so-and-so

Slayer,Temptation,"Have you ever felt the need  
To see more than you can see  
Look into uncertainty  
Reflections of treachery  
Would you leave the world behind  
Endless life is here to find  
Can I interest you in lies  
Sell your soul for all it buys

Play with your insanity  
Shatter your reality  
Pulsing in your blood  
  
I can satisfy your greed  
For now all your debts are free  
I have all eternity  
To quench all the death I breed  
Recreate the rules of play  
From now things are done my way  
None have ever won my game  
Crucified them all in flames  
  
Have you ever danced with the devil  
His temptation ever summoned you  
Ever penned your name in blood  
Let possession slowly swallow you  
When you stand under full moonlight  
The attraction mesmerizes you  
Have you ever wondered why  
It seems that evil you're attracted to  
  
Reach out to my hand  
Step back in time's sand  
Genetic wasteland  
Far beyond death

Olivia Newton-John,I Never Did Sing You A Love Song,"(Nichtern)  
I never did sing you a love song  
I only sang phrases in time  
I never did write you a sonnet  
I just laid my WORDS down in rhymes  
Up and down the river, so many boats to ride  
Yet precious few deliver the goods that we need to survive  
I never spoke falsely or crossly  
I never put tears in your eyes  
And you never shattered my lonely heart  
You never deceived me with lies  
And yet somehow I seem to recall I STIRRED in my sleep for a while  
Dreaming of a river man exchanging my life for a smile

But it doesn't stay

Spent them fast enough

They don't last with just one man  
But baby grand  
Will stand by me  
  
They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio  
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone  
But only songs like these  
Played in minor keys  
Keep those memories holding on  
  
I've come far  
From the life I've strayed in  
I've got scars  
From those dives I've played in  
Now I'm home  
And I'm weary  
In my bones  
Every dreary one night stand  
But baby grand  
Came home with me  
  
Ever since this gig began  
My baby grand's  
Been good to me

And it's a shame  
That you're so afraid  
Just a worker waiting  
In the pouring rain  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Of a broken, of a broken dream

Enrique Iglesias,Love 4 Fun,"So you think  
You got it all worked out  
And what you're searching for  
Isn't what you found  
  
Up in this world  
That's on the run  
A lot of hits but only  
A few number ones  
I'm making love for fun  
  
Are you looking for a holiday?  
I'm making love for fun  
Why would you do it  
Any other way?  
  
I'm making good  
On everything I said  
So baby just relax  
And let me do my thing  
  
Up in my world  
You better run  
There's only room  
For the few who can come  
  
When you don't have  
A place to go  
When everything  
Feels the same  
I can change what  
  
You think you know  
Making love my way

Billy Joel,Travelin' Prayer,"Hey Lord, take a look all around  
And I'd a find where my baby's gonna be  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
'Cause she is far across the sea  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
And make sure that she's gonna be alright  
And things are gonna be alright with me

Said now, would ya guide her on the roads  
And make them softer for her feet

And make sure that she's gonna be alright  
Until she's home and here with me

If she is sleepin' under the sky  
Said now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on  
Is always warm and dry  
Um, don'tcha give her too much rain  
Try to keep her away from pain  
Because my baby hates to cry  
  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
'Cause it gets rough along the way  
Said now, this song seems strange is just because  
I don't know how to pray  
Um, won'tcha give her peace of mind  
And if you ever find the time  
Won'tcha tell her I miss her everyday

Tom T. Hall,The Old Side Of Town,"Ain't it strange how people change and almost overnight  
Who once was a country girl is now a, a socialite  
We're proud for you, but when you're through  
And seek some common ground  
Oh, we miss you on the old side of town  
We still drink cokes and tell old jokes and bowl at Splits and Strikes  
Country music still plays on the jukebox every night  
Society is not for me, but I can still be found  
Oh, we miss you on the old side of town  
RSVP is not for me and black tie's not my style  
I thought you'd like to know 'cause you ain't been here for awhile  
We read about your tour de force, we're glad you get around  
But we miss you on the old side of town  
We still drink cokes and tell old jokes and we bowl at Splits and Strikes  
George Jones is still a hero on the jukebox every night  
Society is not for me, but I can still be found  
Oh, we miss you on the old side of town  
Babe, we miss you on the old side of town

Rick Astley,The Love Has Gone,"The love has gone  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
  
Wake up beside you, and hear you breathing  
And I can feel you in my arms  
No one can know just how I'm feeling  
Knowing that our love can come to no harm  
  
But as I open my eyes  
Then I start to realize  
That you're gone and I can't go on  
  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
  
What have I done girl, to make you leave me  
Didn't I love you for all those years  
  
If you open your eyes  
Baby, then you'll realize  
That you're wrong, and I can't go on  
You know I can't go on  
  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
  
Nothing will ever come between us  
If you will just take me back once more  
I'll show you just how much I love you  
If you'll just come walking through that door  
  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain

Neil Young,Grandpa's Interview,"""Grandpa, here's your coffee,""  
Said Edith, as she filled his cup.  
""Nobody'll find you here,  
And Earl is glad you guys showed up.""  
""The way things are downtown,  
You might have to stay for awhile.  
  
There was a helicopter hovering over your house  
When I talked to your neighbor, Kyle.""  
""Who the hell do they think they are,  
Invading our home like that?  
Grandma and I had to leave so fast,  
We couldn't even catch the cat.""  
  
""The helicopter scared the shit out of him,  
And it took off down a trail,  
Down past the railroad track,  
Towards the county jail.""  
  
""Jed, you really screwed up now!  
What did you have to do that for?  
Everybody wants to hang your ass,  
And here's a note from Lenore.""  
Sun touched the cold steel bars  
As she pushed the paper in.  
Jed took it up and read it  
And he couldn't hide a grin.  
  
Outside the jail window  
A crow flew across the sky,  
Completely disappearing behind each bar,  
Then a helicopter flew by.  
""Say hi to Earl and Edith.  
Tell 'm I'm doing fine.  
Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now,  
They should cut the line.""  
  
""Can grandma come and see me?  
I got a new song to sing  
It's longer than all the others combined  
And it doesn't mean a thing.""  
The noise was unfamiliar,  
Generators whirling,  
Walkie-talkies screaming,  
Vans parked in the open field.  
  
TV crews and cameras,  
They wanted to interview grandpa on the porch.  
They came through the gate and across the lawn  
Knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch.  
And grandpa saw them there,  
Looking through the venetian blind.  
""Those people don't have any respect,  
So they won't get any of mine.""  
  
""I don't wanna talk about Jed.  
I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9.  
I don't have time to talk that fast,  
And it ain't my crime.""  
  
""It ain't a privilege to be on TV  
And it ain't a duty either.  
The only good thing about TV  
Is shows like 'Leave it to Beaver.'""  
  
""'Shows with love and affection',  
Like mama used to say.  
A little Mayberry living  
Could go a long way.""  
  
He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet,  
Loaded up both barrels.  
Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off,  
And up walked a woman named Carol.  
  
""Susan Carol from Early Magazine,  
I got some questions to ask.""  
""Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine!""  
Grandpa said with a gasp.  
  
Then he fell face first and let out a sigh,  
And Edith ran out in shock.  
He was looking at her from down on the floor,  
Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk.  
  
""That guy just keeps singin'!  
Can somebody shut him up?  
I don't know for the life of me  
Where he comes up with that stuff.""  
  
They laid his head on a newspaper  
With a picture of Carmichael on the front page,  
Posing with the little league baseball team,  
And a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle.  
  
Grandpa died a hero.  
Trying to stop the media.  
Fighting for freedom of silence.  
Trying to be anonymous.  
  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Live so long.

As the story unfurls  
Is that you're the hardest thing in the world

I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm  
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough?  
  
Against wrong, choose right and be standin' up  
From the hospital that first night  
Took a hour just ta get the carseat in right  
People drivin' all fast, got me kinda upset  
  
Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette  
That night I don't think one wink I slept  
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept  
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt  
  
'Cause I know I loved you more than life itself  
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please  
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs  
Love, knowledge, discipline too  
I pledge my life to you

Everything I can  
Show you how to be a man  
Dignity, integrity, honor an  
  
An I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it  
An you can cry, ain't no shame it it  
It didn't work out with me an your mom

You was conceived in love  
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track  
Remember one fact, I got your back

It's a full-time job to be a good dad  
You got so much more stuff than I had  
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times  
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM  
  
See me-I'm  
Tryin to pretend I know  
On my PC where that CD go  
But yo, ain't nuthin promised, one day I'll be gone  
  
Feel the strife, but trust life does go wrong  
But just in case  
It's my place  
To impart  
  
One day some girl's gonna break your heart  
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex  
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son  
Throughout life people will make you mad  
  
Disrespect you and treat you bad  
Let God deal with the things they do  
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too  
Always tell the truth, say your prayers  
  
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears  
You're living proof that dreams do come true  
I love you and I'm here for you

Whitney Houston,Count On Me,"[Chorus]  
Count on me through thick and thin  
A friendship that will never end  
When you are weak, I will be strong  
Helping you to carry on  
Call on me, I will be there, don't be afraid  
Please believe me when I say, count on  
  
I can see that it's hurting you, I can feel your pain  
It's hard to see the sunshine, through the rain, oh  
I know sometimes it seems as if, it's never gonna end  
But you'll get through it  
Just don't give in cause you can  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can count on me  
  
I know sometimes it seems as if, we're standing all alone  
Be we'll get through it, 'cause love won't let us fall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a place inside of all of us  
Where our faith in love begins  
You should reach to find the truth in love  
The answers there within, oh  
I know that life can make you feel  
It's much harder than it really is  
But we'll get through it, just don't give in

Dolly Parton,Holdin' On To Nothin',"We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto  
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'  
The years have shown no kindness  
For the hard times we've been through  
  
We've squeezed the life from every dream  
And still go right on bluffin'  
With really nothin' left to hold onto  
  
Oh, why do we keep holding on  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Let's be honest with each other  
That's the least that we can do  
I feel guilty when they envy me and you  
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto  
  
We were young and foolishly mistaken  
Victims of a passion, much too strong to be denied  
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'  
God only knows how long, how hard we've tried  
  
Oh, why do we keep holding on  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Let's be honest with each other  
That's the least that we can do

We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto

Air Supply,Someone,"When you first found love  
Was it all that you had wanted

Back to the enchanted

Someone is waiting till I say yes I do  
Someone is living inside me  
Giving me all that I need and I need you  
Someone to cry on my shoulder

From the secret pool  
Did I stare at your reflection  
Let the water wash away all the battle  
From my soul  
For the bride of spring,  
Do I swear to your protection  
Today will be the day that never shall  
Grow old

Leann Rimes,Upper Hand,"Honey on a teaspoon  
Sugar in a bowl  
An eager man's always an easy catch  
Butter on the skillet  
Whiskey in a glass  
To start a flame you've got to light a match  
  
Ooh you got what he wants  
You got what he wants  
ooh

Got to get a hold, got to get a hold get a hold of your man  
Better get him while, better get him while better get him while you can  
Good to be a lion, good to be a lion instead of a lamb  
Use what you got take the upper hand  
  
Always be a lady  
But tease him like a tramp  
A temptation that's hard to resist  
Treat him like a hero  
  
Let him long to be your slave  
Take advantage of your God given gift  
  
Ooh you know what he wants  
You know what he wants

Generations before will testify it's true  
Girl your gonna see how much he really loves you

Side A,Tell Me,"There are nights when I can't help but cry  
And I wonder why you have to leave me  
  
Why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Tell me  
Where did I go wrong?  
What did I do to make you change your mind completely  
When I thought  
This love would never end  
But if this love's not ours to have  
I'll let it go  
With your goodbye  
  
Why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me

But if this love's not ours to have

David Bowie,Conversation Piece,"I took this walk  
To ease my mind  
To find out what's gnawing at me  
Wouldn't think, to look at me,  
That I've spent a lot of time in education  
It all seems so long ago  
I'm a thinker, not a talker  
I've no-one to talk to, anyway  
  
I can't see the road  
For the rain in my eyes  
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh  
  
I live above the grocers store,  
Owned by an Austrian  
He often calls me down to eat  
And he jokes about his broken English,  
Tries to be a friend to me  
But for all my years  
Of reading conversation,  
I stand without a word to say  
  
I can't see the bridge  
For the rain in my eyes  
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh  
  
And the world is full of life  
Full of folk who don't know me  
And they walk in twos or threes or more  
While the light  
That shines above the grocer's store  
Investigates my face so rudely  
And my essays lying  
Scattered on the floor  
Fulfill their needs just by being there  
And my hands shake, my head hurts,  
My voice sticks inside my throat  
I'm invisible and dumb  
No-one will recall me  
  
And I can't see the water  
Through the tears in my ey-y-yes  
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh

Electric Light Orchestra,After All,"The night has a thousand eyes  
And they're all on you  
The night has a thousand ears  
Listening to your cries  
Let it work its magic  
Let it work its magic  
The night has a thousand eyes  
  
You, you had to slip away  
After all that spark  
You, said all that you could say  
And slipped into the dark  
I could not let you go  
Alone into the night  
I had to let you know  
The magic there, in the night air  
  
The night has a thousand eyes  
And they're all on you  
The night has a thousand ears  
Listening to your cries  
Let it work its magic  
Let it work its magic  
The night has a thousand eyes  
  
You, somewhere out in the dark  
Runs a wounded heart  
You, stumbling in the night  
In the air of after light  
You take along the fears  
Did you waste these years  
And did they warn you  
Of the night zone all alone  
  
Sometimes it takes a fight  
To keep everything on track  
And sometimes it takes a starry night  
To bring the magic back  
This was the time  
And this was the place  
With starlight on your face  
And the moon on the rise  
The night has a thousand eyes

Poison,Come Hell Or High Water,"I've got no worries  
I've got no regrets  
Who they think they're kidding  
They ain't seen nothing yet  
  
You point my finger try to tell me I'm wrong  
That never stopped me from singin' my song  
I got the last laugh at the things they do  
Eliminate them at the turn of a screw

Can't push me no matter how hard they try  
Stand back, it's my turn to fly

and miles of endless lies  
Their jaded lives  
Couldn't erase my smile  
  
But what's this shit that I just heard  
Son of a bitch you're working on my nerves  
I'll watch you choke on your last words  
It's about time you got what you deserved

I won't be sinking on that ship of fools  
Can't push me no matter how hard they try  
Stand back, it's my turn to fly

Come close I'll tell you the problem that I find

Blame yourself for the ghosts in your past  
Kiss my ass

Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
And soon my tears they will be falling like rain  
It always seems to be a Monday  
Left over memories of Sunday  
Always spent with you before the clouds appear  
And took away my sunshine  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
And I'll be dreaming of you baby in vain  
Your face is always on my mind girl  
I hope that soon you're gonna find girl  
Your way back to me  
Cause if you say you'll stay, the rainy days would go away  
Misty morning eyes I'm trying to disguise the way I feel  
But I just can't hide it

The loneliness will show  
I'm thinking of my pride but breaking up inside girl... Whoaaa

And soon my tears they will be falling like rain

Left over memories of Sunday

Does she see me at her feet it's hard to tell  
But if I ask her she might turn her smile away  
To see her as I'd see a star  
Love her from where you are

Without a grasping hand  
Minor contentment wears a smile

Rescues a dreary Sunday  
Who makes me feel like painting again

Drive out to Binky's place

Who's not afraid to try new things  
Who gets to spend her birthday in Spain

And all she wants to do is dance

And all she wants to do is dance, dance

In the kitchen sink  
And all she wants to do is dance

In the local disco lounge  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
To keep the boys from sellin'  
All the weapons they could scrounge  
And all she wants to do is dance

All the drugs that they can do

For the last plane out  
As we taxied down the runway  
I could hear the people shout  
They said, ""don't come back here Yankee""  
But if I ever do  
I'll bring more money  
Cause all she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
Never mind the heat  
Comin' off the street

Inside the labyrinth where buried is the king his waiting maids countless

As they walk through the passages of endless night using sparsely the candles
as their only light  
Living only on the storages of food they brought no escape live to die becomes
their only thought  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king Tutankhamun  
Cursed where this grave is their only thing Kking Tutankhamun

reign to flourish in the dark

Living only on the storages of food they brought no escape live to die becomes
their only thought  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king Tutankhamun  
Cursed where this grave is their only thing king Tutankhamun  
And as they walk through the passages of endless night  
Drawing nearer to the last nothing left inside the tomb  
Except the braindead plight lost in histories of the past

And you start breaking down  
In the pouring rain  
Well you've been on a fast train  
  
When your lover has gone away don't it make you feet so sad  
And you go on a journey way into the land  
And you start breaking down  
Cause you're under the strain  
And you jump on a fast train  
  
You had to go on the lam you stepped into no-man's land  
Ain't nobody here on your waveband  
Ain't nobody gonna give you a helping hand  
And you start breaking down  
And just go into the sound  
When you hear that fast train  
  
And you keep moving on to the sound of the wheels  
And deep inside your heart you really know oh, just how it feels  
And you start breaking down and go into the pain  
Keep on moving on a fast train  
  
You're way over the line next thing you're out of your mind  
And you're out of your depth in through the window she crept  
Oh there's nowhere to go in the sleet and the snow  
Just keep on moving on a fast train  
  
You had to go on the lam stepping in no-man's land  
Ain't nobody here on your waveband  
Nobody even gonna lend you a helping hand  
Oh and you're so alone can you really make it on your own  
Keep on moving on a fast train  
  
Oh going nowhere, except on a fast train  
Oh trying to get away from the past  
Oh keep on moving keep on moving on a fast train  
Going nowhere, across the desert sand, through the barren waste  
On a fast train going nowhere  
On a fast train going nowhere

And as the rain beats down,  
Upon my weary eyes.

Your name and mine inside a heart, upon the wall,  
Still find a way to haunt me,  
Though they're so small.  
  
Just walk away renee,  
You won't see me follow you back home.  
These empty sidewalks on my block  
Are not the same.  
You're not to blame.

Nothing's right until you're back again  
Nothing's broken when it's softly spoken

Go for a ride in the driving rain

One, two, three, four, five let's go for a drive

You come walking through my door  
Like the one that I've been waiting for  
Letting sunshine in the darkest places when I've been going there again  
  
So why don't we drive in the rain  
Straight to the eye of the hurricane  
  
Why don't we drive in the rain

Say things I take back  
If I could, could retell

Billy Joel,Lullabye,"Goodnight, my angel  
Time to close your eyes  
And save these questions for another day  
I think I know what you've been asking me  
I think you know what I've been trying to say  
I promised I would never leave you  
And you should always know  
Wherever you may go  
No matter where you are  
I never will be far away  
  
Goodnight, my angel  
Now it's time to sleep  
And still so many things I want to say  
Remember all the songs you sang for me  
When we went sailing on an emerald bay  
And like a boat out on the ocean  
I'm rocking you to sleep  
The water's dark  
And deep inside this ancient heart  
You'll always be a part of me  
  
Goodnight, my angel  
Now it's time to dream  
And dream how wonderful your life will be  
Someday your child may cry  
And if you sing this lullabye  
Then in your heart  
There will always be a part of me  
  
Someday we'll all be gone  
But lullabyes go on and on...  
They never die  
That's how you  
And I  
Will be

Smiths,Vicar In A Tutu,"I was minding my business  
Lifting some lead off  
The roof of the Holy Name church  
It was worthwhile living a laughable life  
To set my eyes on the blistering sight  
Of a Vicar in a tutu  
He's not strange  
He just wants to live his life this way  
  
A scanty bit of a thing  
With a decorative ring  
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose  
As Rose collects the money in a canister  
Who comes sliding down the bannister ?  
The Vicar in a tutu  
He's not strange  
He just wants to live his life this way  
  
The monkish monsignor  
With a head full of plaster  
Said : ""My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned""  
As Rose counts the money in the canister  
As natural as rain  
He dances again  
My God!  
The Vicar in a tutu  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh...  
The Vicar in a tutu  
Oh yeah  
Oh...  
  
The next day in the pulpit  
With freedom and ease  
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease  
As Rose counts the money in the canister  
As natural as rain  
He dances again and again and again  
  
In the fabric of a tutu  
Any man could get used to  
And I am the living sign  
And I'm a living sign  
I am a living sign

You were talking so brave and so sweet,  
Giving me head on the unmade bed,  
While the limousines wait in the street.  
Those were the reasons and that was new york,  
We were running for the money and the flesh.  
And that was called love for the workers in song  
Probably still is for those of them left.  
Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,  
You just turned your back on the crowd,  
You got away, I never once heard you say,  
I need you, I don't need you,  
I need you, I don't need you  
And all of that jiving around.  
I remember you well in the chelsea hotel  
You were famous, your heart was a legend.  
You told me again you preferred handsome men  
But for me you would make an exception.  
And clenching your fist for the ones like us  
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,  
You fixed yourself, you said, ""well never mind,  
We are ugly but we have the music.""  
And then you got away, didn't you babe...  
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best,  
I can't keep track of each fallen robin.

John Denver,Peace Poem,"There's a name for war and killing  
There's a name for giving in  
When you know another answer  
For me the name is sin  
But there's still time to turn around  
And make all hatred cease  
And give another name to living  
And we could call it peace  
And peace would be the road we walk  
Each step along the way  
And peace would be the way we work  
And peace the way we play  
And in all we see that's different  
And in all the things we know  
Peace would be the way we look  
And peace the way we grow  
There's a name for separation  
There's a name for first and last  
When it's all for us or nothing  
For me the name is past  
But there's still time to turn around  
And make all hatred cease  
And give a name to all the future  
And we could call it peace  
And if peace is what we pray for  
And peace is what we give  
Then peace will be the way we are  
And peace the way we live  
Yes there still is the time to turn around  
And make all hatred cease  
And give another name to living  
And we can call it peace

Maafkanlah ku tak bisa tinggalkan dirinya...  
  
Simpan sisa-sisa cerita cinta berdua,  
Walau tak tercipta cerita cinta berdua...  
  
Still I have in my eyes,  
Still I have forever...  
  
Memang salahku yg tak pernah bisa,  
Meninggalkan dirinya 'tuk bersama kamu,  
Walau 'tuk terus bersama kan ada hati akan terluka,  
Dan ku tahu kau tak mahu...  
  
Skali lagi maafkanlah,  
Karna aku cinta kau dan dia,  
Maafkanlah ku tak bisa tinggalkan dirinya...

Vince Gill,Loving You Makes Me A Better Man,"Loving you makes me a better man  
These things I don't know how to do  
But you make me think I can  
  
I've got a long way to go  
But I know what I know like the back of my hand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
  
I've been wrong, more than I cared to say  
Time after time I've been lost  
Just couldn't find my way  
  
You shed a light on the path through the night  
Leading right to the side where I stand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
  
I make mistakes, didn't have what it takes  
Just to walk out leave it alone  
I've got a long lot of heartaches that follow me home  
  
Time goes on and I watch you disappear  
I've got a mount to mount  
Now that I have you near  
  
You came to me and it's easy to see  
There's a line that I've crossed in the sand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
Loving you makes me a better man

Judas Priest,Steeler,"Catch the play now, eye to eye  
Don't let chances pass you by  
Always someone at your back  
Biding their time for attack  
  
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged  
Double-crossers get your head  
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike  
Kiss of Judas, spider like  
  
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you  
Wolves in sheeps clothing, slow death in consoling  
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected  
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you  
  
Tricksters, jilters play their game  
Sleight-of-handers, all the same  
Masquerader in his lair  
Wants to tangle in your hair

Better not go chasing rainbows

Who's holding you tonight  
I just want to love you

Every morning, noon and night  
  
There's gotta be a way to show you  
I'd really like to get to know you  
I could make you happy  
If you'd take a chance on me  
  
Don't want to talk about forever  
Can't you see it's now or never  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Take a change on me  
  
You know it makes me so excited  
Every time i think of you  
It turns me round and puts me in a spin  
Oh can't you see

Look out your window and I'll be gone

Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe

To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe  
Like you never did before  
And there ain't no use in calling out my name  
Cause I can't hear you anymore  
  
Well, I'm thinking and wondering while I'm way down on the road  
I once loved a man but that love grew old  
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
But goodbye is too good away, babe  
So I'm gonna say farewell  
  
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind  
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind  
But you just kinda wasted my precious time

Josh Groban,All I Ask Of You,"No more talk of darkness  
Forget these wide-eyed fears  
I'm here, nothing can harm you  
My words will warm and calm you  
  
Let me be your freedom  
Let daylight dry your tears  
I'm here, with you, beside you  
To guard you and to guide you  
  
Say you'll love me every waking moment  
Turn my head with talk of summer time  
Say you need me with you now and always  
Promise me that all you say is true  
That's all I ask of you  
  
Let me be your shelter  
Let me be your light  
You're safe, no one will find you  
Your fears are far behind you  
  
All I want is freedom  
A world with no more night  
And you, always beside me  
To hold me and to hide me  
  
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime  
Let me lead you from your solitude  
Say you need me with you here, beside you  
Anywhere you go, let me go too

Love me, that's all I ask of you.  
  
Anywhere you go, let me go too  
Love me, that's all I ask of you  
  
I gave you my music, made your song take wing.  
And now, how you've repaid me, denied me and betrayed me.  
He was bound to love you, when he heard you sing.

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime  
Say the word and I will follow you  
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...

All that the Phantom asked of you!

Yazoo,Unmarked,"Go and join the army  
Said the father to the son  
See the world around you boy  
And learn to use a gun  
Think you're something special  
Well, we'll make you just the same  
There's nothing wrong in dying  
After all, it's just a game  
Just a game.  
  
Read the morning paper  
There's a picture of a cross  
""we were proud in them days""  
By the way, I think you lost  
Trust me when I tell you boy  
That god is on our side  
Even Jesus cheers us on  
Against the other side  
Against the other side.  
  
He who shouts the loudest  
Is the one who's in control  
We who never listen  
Are the ones who pay the toll  
Tell us that it's time at last  
To make a final stand  
I'm glad 'cause all I wanted  
Was to kill another man  
Just to kill another man.

Lose  
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to

Glen Campbell,Friends,"Friends are never earned they're a gift from the loving God  
And they're precious beyond human evaluation  
But you dare not take them for granted or they'll lift away like a smoke  
And the warmth of their caring will vanish into the chill of the endless
nights  
Most of my friends are unknowns they probably won't even rate an obituary  
Unless they live and die in a small town  
Somewhere where nothing much ever happens  
But a few of my friends are big people  
They'd made the word ring with laughter down to this string of court  
They're famous sensitive talented and their names are household words  
And yet they're no more precious in God's eyes or in mine  
Than those wonderful nobody's who live and die in small towns  
Who is your friend he's someone who warms you with a nod  
Or with an unspoken word in hard times when you're hurting beyond words  
Who is your friend he's someone who holds you to her breast  
And sighs softly into your hair when no other medicine could possibly stop the
pain  
A friend is someone who clings his glass against yours  
Or answers the phone at three in the morning when you're lost  
And with a few words of encouragement and concern  
Makes you realize that you're not really lost at all  
Friends come in both sexes in all shapes and sizes  
The most important thing they have in common is their ability  
To share with you your most sky splitting joys  
Or your deepest most spelling ol' some sorrows for they're all your friends

Who fed you fish and scratched your ears  
You'd notice him  
Suppose you was a woman wed  
And sleepin' in a double bed beside one man for seven years  
You'd notice him  
A human being's made of more than air  
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there  
Unless that human bein' next to you  
Is unimpressive, undistinquished  
You know who

Usher,Final Goodbye,"It's time to say goodbye  
It's over now  
It's time to say goodbye  
  
Is there a reason why our love could not last  
I ask was it too strong for you to hold on pretty  
Lady  
I thought we had a master plan  
But it takes a stronger man to walk away  
Than to watch our love fade away  
  
I often wonder how and why  
I did not cheat I did not lie  
I hope you know how hard I tried  
But it's over for now  
It's time to say goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't believe how suddenly things change  
Yesterday we were in love but all I feel were  
Heartaches  
And pain  
Day and night I tried deep inside to work things out  
But in my heart I knew  
I still had my doubts  
  
I thought we made a symphony  
It's over now no more harmony  
I prayed so hard for love to fly (oh yeah)  
It's time to say goodbye  
Ooh bye bye bye bye bye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sorry I gotta leave  
Baby I'm beggin' please  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
Bye bye bye bye

Prince,Dear Mr. Man,"What's wrong with the world today?  
Things just got to get better  
Sho' ain't what the leaders say  
Maybe we should write a letter  
  
Dear Mr. Man  
We don't understand  
Why poor people keep struggling  
But you don't lend a helping hand  
  
Matthew 5:5 say,  
The meek shall inherit the earth  
We wanna be down that way  
But you been tripping since the day of you're birth  
  
Who said that to kill is a sin  
Then started every single war  
That you're people been in?  
Who said that water  
Is a precious commodity  
Then dropped a big old black oil slick  
In the deep blue sea?  
  
Who told me, Mr. Man  
That working round the clock  
Would buy me a big house in the 'hood  
With cigarette ads on every block  
  
Who told me Mr. Man  
That I got a right to moan?  
How 'bout this big ol' hole in the ozone?  
  
What's wrong with the world today  
Things just got to get better  
Dear Mr. Man, we don't understand  
Maybe we should write a letter

Same song with a different name  
Might not be in the back of the bus  
But it sho' feel just the same  
Ain't nothin' fair about welfare  
Ain't no assistance in AIDS  
Ain't nothing affirmative about you're actions  
Till the people get paid  
  
You're thousand years are up  
Now you got to share the land  
Section one, the fourteenth Amendment says:  
No state shall deprive any person  
Of life, liberty, or property  
Without due process of law

""We tired you all!""

Or shining for the rest of the world  
Give me just a smile and would you make it snappy

Is would you maybe, come dancing with me  
'Cause to me it doesn't matter  
If your hopes and dreams are shattered  
'Cause when you say something you make me believe  
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt  
She knows exactly what she's worth  
Knows exactly what she's worth to me!  
That I can see, I can see  
If you ever find yourself inside a bubble  
You've gotta make your own way home  
You can call me anytime you're seeing double  
Now you know you're not alone

Without your noose  
You gave me something that I didn't have  
But had no use  
I was too weak to give in  
Too strong to lose  
My heart is under arrest again  
But I break loose  
My head is giving me life or death  
But I can't choose  
I swear I'll never give in  
I refuse

Green Day,I See The Light,"I crossed the river  
Fell into the sea  
Where the non-believers  
Go beyond belief  
Then I scratched the surface  
In the mouth of hell  
Running out of service  
In the blood I fell

Well I - I just want to see the light  
And I - I don't want to lose my sight  
Well I - I just want to see the light  
And I need to know what's worth the fight  
  
I've been wasted  
Pills and alcohol  
I've been chasing  
Down the pool halls  
Then I drank the water  
From a hurricane  
And I set a fire  
Just to see the flame

I crossed the desert  
Reaching higher ground  
Then I pound the pavement  
To take the liars down  
But it's gone forever  
But never too late  
Where the ever-after  
Is in the hands of fate

Afraid to speak your mind?

Now I know the reasons for the other side,  
And I see a different point of view this time.  
I will be a stronger person if I try.  
I will see the other side of this day.  
  
Are they really controlling

Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?

Eurythmics,Better To Have Lost In Love,"Cool tears flow upon my pillow.  
And i'm freezing blue with misery.  
You know that i never meant to hurt you  
But something always gets right in the way.  
  
So i'll fill this bedrom full of mystery.  
Hang our last conclusions on the wall.  
And if this empty building starts to get to me  
Please remember that it just might be your fault.  
  
Better to have lost in love  
Than never to have loved at all...  
  
So the fated lovers turn to enemies -  
And all their hidden feelings start to show.  
And i never though that boy  
Could mean so much to me.  
And now it seems i'll have to let you go...

So we pretend to look for answers  
While I blame you and you blame me

Why are you so happy?  
What do you know that I don't know?  
I wish I did but aint been told  
So tell me, what's your secret?  
I met a girl the other day at the supermarket  
Ringing up all of my things  
She had the strangest look upon her face  
Wish you could have been there  
Just to see the way she looked at me  
Thought I must look crazy something out of place  
But paid it no attention  
Just kept going with my business  
I looked up because she stepped into my space  
Saw pain in her eyes  
Her question took me by surprise she said  
I didn't have the faintest clue where to begin  
So I asked some questions (just to see what I was dealing with)  
She told me where she was and where it was she'd been  
What an awful tale life hadnt done her well  
She had thoughts of leaving  
Bridge:  
(Before you go) let me tell my story  
(Once like you, you know) all guts and no glory  
(But now I have joy) the reason why  
Whos in my life  
That is why you're asking me  
See the moral of the story is the whole worlds watching you  
So be careful what you say and be careful what you do  
Never know when it will be your time to show someone the way  
So be a guiding light and shine so they'll say

But I will follow my illness  
To the possible lines  
I'll choose right decision

King Diamond,Little One,"""Mommy... mommy... mommy... mommy""  
  
Later that Night in her Room, Abigail was drifting off to sleep.  
All of what she had seen Today, was hard to believe.  
  
Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain  
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy  
And that's a shame  
  
Abigail was quickly on her feet  
Down the stairs and into the dark, Abigail was following the sound  
And there she was: the child  
  
It was clearly a ghost, the ghost from the gate in the storm  
""Little girl, tell me who you are?""  
""I am your spirit twin from years ago, I'm little one""  
  
That brought back memories of Abigail when turning six  
Sneaking out of bed, like she always did  
  
Hiding in the dark, listening to the men  
Tell their stories from way back then  
She remembered the story of Jonathan  
  
And they'd been talking about the Little One  
  
Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain  
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy  
And that's a shame  
  
Abigail she knew she had to stay  
Saving Little One and breaking the chain, breaking the chain

Amy Grant,First Love,"You are my first love sweet and gentle as the night  
Just being near  
You now is like a lullaby  
All that I have I'd give away to follow You  
I can't imagine having life without you  
Oh. When all these worldly battles seem to never cease  
You simply lift me up and rest me in Your peace  
I heard some people say you're only in my mind  
I hope that someday You choose to find them.  
All other loves will slowly fade like dying flame  
Tomorrow, now, and yesterday  
You're still the same I wait with longing heart to see You come again  
Your sweet and tender love will never end.

John Denver,Nothing But A Breeze,"Life is just too short for some folks  
For other folks it just drags on  
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey  
Others figure tea's too strong  
  
Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride the middle  
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth  
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie  
And my head in the cool blue north  
  
In a small suburban garden  
Not a single neighbour knows our name  
I know the woman wishes we would move some place  
Where the houses aren't all the same  
  
Jesse, I wish you would take mewhere the grass is greener  
I couldn't really say where it may be  
Oh, some place high on a montain top  
Bown by the deep blue sea  
  
And there we'll do just as we please  
It ain't nothing but a breeze  
  
One day I'll be old gray Grandpa  
All the pretty girls will call me ""Sir""  
Now where they're asking me how things are  
Soon they'll ask me how things are  
  
Well, I don't mind being an old gray Grandpa  
As long as you'll be my gray Grandma  
But I wish we would move with our tea and cookies  
To the shade of the old pawpaw  
  
There we'll do just as we please  
It ain't nothing but a breeze  
  
Life is just too short for some folks  
For other foks it just drags on  
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey  
Others figure tea's too strong  
  
Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride in the middle  
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth  
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie  
And my head in the cool blue north

Directly from my heart to you  
Oh, you know that I love you  
That's why I feel so blue  
  
Oh, I pray

Yeah, we'd be so happy together  
But you're so far away

Conway Twitty,Born To Sing The Blues,"Born to sing the blues  
So tired an' worn, just singin' the blues  
Alone right from the start,  
I walked alone with blues in my heart.  
  
True love, (true love) I've never known (I've never known.)  
Everything (everything) I do is wrong. (all wrong.)  
But wrong, I've always been  
It's hard to go on when I never win.  
  
My life, (my life) my destiny, (my destiny.)  
Is loneliness (loneliness) and misery. (misery.)  
My life, I didn't choose.  
I guess, I was born to sing the blues.  
  
The lonesome blues,  
The weary blues

Madonna,More,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,  
Which was fine with me.  
Because I had rhythm, music, love,  
The sun, the stars and the moon above,  
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.  
That was when the best things in life were free.  
  
Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,  
Which is fine with me.  
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,  
But look at what I got to go with 'em.  
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.  
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.  
  
Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.  
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!  
  
Count your blessings, one, two, three  
I just hate keeping score.  
Any number is fine with me  
As long as it's more  
As long as it's more!  
  
I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition  
I find counting a bore.  
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.  
[More! More!]  
  
I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before  
Got my guy and my sky of blue,  
Now, however, I own the view.  
More is better than nothing, true  
But nothing's better than more, more, more  
Nothing's better than more.  
  
One is fun, why not two?  
And if you like two, you might as well have four,  
And if you like four, why not a few  
Why not a slew  
[More! More!]  
  
If you've got a little, why not a lot?  
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.  
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot  
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.  
[More! More!]  
  
Never say when, never stop at plenty,  
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.  
Happy with ten, happier with twenty  
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?  
  
Or does that sound too greedy?  
That's not greed, no, indeedy  
That's just stocking the store  
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.  
[More! More!]  
  
Each possession you possess  
Helps your spirits to soar.  
That's what's soothing about excess  
Never settle for something less.  
Something's better than nothing, yes!  
But nothing's better than more, more more  
[Except all, all, all]  
Except all, all, all  
Except once you have it all [have it all]  
You may find all else above [find all else above]  
That though things are bliss,  
There's one thing you miss, and that's  
More! More!  
More! More! More! More!  
More! More! More!

Don't take this heaven from one  
If you must cling to someone  
Now and forever

Oliver,The Greatest Story Ever Told,"""Thank you for this moment  
I got to say how beautiful you are  
Of all the hope and dreams I could of prayd for  
There you are  
If I could have one dance forever  
I would take you by the hand  
Tonight it's you and I together  
I'm sooo glad  
I'm your man  
  
And if I live a thousand years you know I never could explain  
The way I lost my heart to you that day  
But If destiny decided I should look the other way  
Then the world would never know  
The greatest story ever told  
And Did I tell you that I love you tonight  
  
I don't hear the music  
When I'm looking In your eyes  
But I feel the rhythm of your body close to mine  
It's the way we touch it sends me  
It's the way well always be  
Your kiss, your pretty smile you know I die for  
Ooo baby  
Your all I need  
  
And if I live a thousand years you know I never could explain  
The way I lost my heart to you that day

George Michael,December Song (I Dreamed Of Christmas),"Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas  
May your every New Year dream come...  
  
Sweet December song  
The melody that saved me  
On those less than Silent Nights  
When snow would fall upon my bed  
Like sugar from Jesus  
And take me to the day  
She could always smile  
The Virgin Child would always show you see  
Just to save me (Just to save me)  
There was always Christmas time  
To wipe the year away  
I guess that Mum and Dad decided  
That the world would have to wait  
  
There was always Christmas time  
Jesus came to stay  
I could believe in peace on Earth  
And I could watch TV all day  
So I dreamed of Christmas  
  
Maybe since you've gone  
I went a little crazy  
God knows they can see the child  
  
But the snow that falls upon my bed  
That loving I needed  
Falls every single day  
For each and every child  
The Virgin smiles for all to see  
But you kept her from me  
  
There was always Christmas time  
To wipe the year away  
I guess that Mum and Dad decided  
That the world would have to wait  
  
There was always Christmas time  
Jesus came to stay  
I could believe in peace on Earth  
And I could watch TV all day  
And so I dreamed of Christmas  
Yes I dreamed like you  
  
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas  
May your every New Year dream come true

Supertramp,You Started Laughing,"When you're in heaven  
What you gonna do?  
You're gonna sit around a cloud and say  
""Hey, what a lovely view""  
Is there a reason, why you're like you are?  
Is there a reason you'll be leaving?  
Is my love out of season?  
I wouldn't mind but to me that is Treason  
You started laughing  
When I held you in my arms  
You started leaving  
When I told you of my charms  
I was in love with you and then you said, we're through  
And then I said, ""Boo hoo""  
Was my tie not on straight?  
Was it something I ate?

Chuck Berry,Back To Memphis,"I've been struggling up here, child, trying to make a living  
Everybody wants to take, nobody like giving  
I wish I was in Memphis back home there with my Mama  
The only clothes I got left that ain't rags is my pajamas  
No brotherly love, no help, no danger  
Just a great big town full of cold hearted strangers  
I went hungry in New York and Chicago was no better  
But today, my dear mother wrote and told me in her letter  
Son, come back to Memphis and live here with your Mama  
You can walk down Beale Street, honey, wearing your pajamas  
You know home folks here, we let do just what you want to  
And I born you and raised you right here on the corner  
I'm going to leave here in the morning and walk down to the station  
I've got just enough money to pay my transportation  
I'm going back to Memphis, back home with my Mama  
If I have to ride that bus barefooted in pajamas  
Back home in Memphis, no moaning and groaning  
I know everything will be all right in the morning

Lights shine illumination bright  
Reveal all the madness here tonight

Night after night, the main attraction  
A strange world that you might want to know  
When it comes alive - crank, crank, crank, crank the show

So far apart, left me with this lonely broken heart

Baby I can't stop thinking about love tonight  
Can't even tell you what's wrong or right  
I need you here to love me for the rest of my life

Can't stop thinking 'bout you?.

Oozing like napalm from the speakers and grill  
Of your radio  
Into the mouths of babes  
And across the backs of its willing slaves  
  
Funk pop a roll consumes you whole  
Gulping in your opium so copiously from a disco  
Everything you eat is waste  
But swallowing is easy when it has no taste  
  
They can fix you rabbits up  
With your musical feed  
They can fix you rabbits up  
Big money selling you stuff that you do not need  
  
Funk pop a roll for fish in shoals  
Music by the yard for the children they keep  
Like poseable dolls  
The young to them are mistakes  
Who only want bread but they're force-fed cake  
  
Funk pop a roll the only goal  
The music business is a hammer to keep  
You pegs in your holes  
But please don't listen to me  
I've already been poisoned by this industry!

He sent me the sheet music on it,  
And I don't know anyone that reads music  
Except, maybe Helen

Under some green growing tree  
Clear cool water running by  
An unfettered view of the sky  
But I don't know where I'm bound  
  
When I die don't bury me  
Cause then I must be free  
Cremate my body with a grin  
Throw my ashes to the wind

Whistles calling me away  
Leaving at the break of day  
And I don't know where I'm bound  
  
Got myself a little gal  
She has been a damn right pall  
That ol' highway's calling me  
And free I gotta be but  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound

Seeking an answer  
To why they were born

Accept no pay

All for longing causes  
Racing minds and lengthy pauses  
All who must soon shed their veils  
And wipe their eyes  
As we vegetate and wait around for brighter days  
And can dance contented to the sound of money  
Could I have seen a sight  
Much greater than your twilight eyes  
That penetrate your silent lives (lies)

To make us all feel better  
Under darker skies  
With your twilight eyes

And my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long ways from home  
And I missed my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big seven o seven set to go  
Well I'm out here on the grass  
Where the pavement never grows  
Where the liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
There she goes my friend  
She's rolling out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wing on high  
She's away and westward bound  
For above the clouds she flies  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home  
In about three hours time  
  
This ol' airport's got me down  
It's no earthly good to me  
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
Can't jump a jet plane  
Like you can a freight train  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain

The only exception I know is the case  
Where I'm out on a quiet spree  
Fighting vainly the old ennui  
And I suddenly turn and see  
Your fabulous face.  
  
I get no kick from champagne.  
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all,  
So tell me why should it be true  
That I get a kick out of you?  
  
Some get a kick from cocaine.  
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff  
That would bore me terrific'ly too,  
Yet I get a kick out of you.  
  
I get a kick everything I see  
You're standing there before me.  
I get a kick though it's clear to me  
You obviously don't adore me.  
  
I get no kick in a plane.  
Flying too high with some guy in the sky  
Is my idea of nothing to do,

I've been drunk since last Saturday,  
better stay out of my way  
  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
Never take that dive  
Feel so alive  
Doing 95  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
I drink and drive  
  
Early in the morning and the freeway's deserted, like its all mine  
I'm trying to set a new drunken speed record,  
but I can't drive a straight line  
Flashing lights, split the night  
I'm tossing bottles as I swerve to the right  
now I've slammed my face into the back of a big rig  
At least you'll never get me, you fucking pigs!  
Designate someone other than me,  
I'm so drunk I can hardly see  
Another shot of Jager and I turn the key,  
I got so many places to be  
  
When I'm on a binge, my friends all cringe  
They won't drive at night  
'Cause way down on the freeway it's such a fright  
But I think I drive alright

Coldplay,Talk,"Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through  
I've been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don' know what to do  
Oh brother, I can't believe it's true  
I'm so scared about the future, and I wanna talk to you  
Oh, I wanna talk to you  
  
You can take a picture of something you see  
In the future where will I be?  
You can climb a ladder up to the sun  
Or a write a song nobody has sung  
Or do something that's never been done  
  
Are you lost or incomplete?  
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?  
Tell me, how do you feel?  
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak  
And they're talking it to me  
  
So you take a picture of something you see  
In the future where will I be?  
You can climb a ladder up to the sun  
Or write a song nobody has sung  
Or do something that's never been done  
Or do something that's never been done  
  
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk  
And you feel like you're going where you've been before  
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored  
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk  
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk

Verve,History,"I wander lonely streets  
Behind where the old Thames does flow  
And in every face I meet  
Reminds me of what I have run from  
In every man, in every hand  
In every kiss, you understand  
That living is for other men  
I hope you two will understand  
I've got to tell you my tale  
Of how I loved and how I failed  
I hope you understand  
I've got to tell you my tale  
Of how I loved and how I failed  
I hope you understand  
These feelings should not be in the man  
In every child, in every eye  
In every sky, above my head  
I hope that I know  
So come with me in bed  
Because it's you and me, we're history  
There ain't nothing left to say  
When I will get you alone  
Maybe we could find a room  
Where we could see what we should do  
Maybe you know it's true  
Living with me is like keeping a fool  
In every man, in every hand  
In every kiss, you understand  
That living is for other men  
I hope you know that I am me so come on  
I'm thinking about history  
And I'm living for history  
And I think you know about me  
'Cause I am  
And one and one is two  
But three is company  
When you're thinking about the things you do  
And you're thinking about the things you do  
I want to tell you my tale  
How I fell in love and jumped out on my bail  
I hope you understand there's more in a smile than in a hand  
In every sky, in every kiss  
There's something that I might have missed  
Why am I going to  
A place that now belongs to you  
But you were weak and so was I  
Let's pick it up, let's even try  
To live today, so why not smile  
Don't dream away your life 'Cause it is mine  
Is that a crime, is that a crime, this life is mine  
The bed ain't made but it's filled full of hope  
I've got a skin full of dope

Tragically Hip,The Depression Suite,"Under the pillow

As it turns out there's a whole other world of sounds  
Of perfect fifths low skids and Arctic howls  
  
All saying are you going through something?  
Are you going through something?  
  
Under the pillow a little room to breathe  
The early morning light's a pale cranberry  
I hear the not-wow-wow  
Of a siren faraway and closing steadily  
  
Saying Are you going through something?  
Are you going through something?  
Cause I-I-I-I I am too  
  
Under the pillow  
I can hear you whisperin' are you going through something?  
  
Well honey are you going through something?

I'm emptying slots working like a ghost  
I move through huge rooms with no windows  
And no Gulf of Mexico

When the door is just starting to open?  
When Athabasca depends?  
Don't you wanna see how it ends

But I can't stay here  
You left me lost in the Barrens  
You left me born on the stairs  
It's minus 11  
Inside my kettle  
I didn't come to get lost in the Barrens  
I didn't come to settle  
To be a man on the moon  
To get my little slice of heaven

Give me just a little nod, I could fascinate you

If you just can't speak to me, just throw me a line  
Give me just a little nod, you are fascinated

We could throw this party and take off on our own  
Find our own higher place, an odessy back home

In my darkest rose and pennant, I am so alone

Paul Simon,The Coast,"A family of musicians took shelter for the night  
In the little harbor church of St. Cecilia  
Two guitars, bata, bass drum and tambourine  
Rose of Jericho and Bougainvillea  
  
This is a lonely life  
Sorrows everywhere you turn  
And that's worth something  
When you think about it  
That's worth some money  
That's worth something  
When you think about it  
That is worth some money  
  
A trip to the market  
A trip into the pearl gray morning sunlight  
Settling over Washington  
A trip to the market  
A trip around the world  
Where the evening meal  
Is negotiable, if there is one.  
  
This is a lonely life  
Sorrows everywhere you turn  
And that's worth something  
When you think about it  
That's worth some money  
That's worth something  
When you think about it  
That is worth some money  
  
To prove that I love you  
Because I believe in you  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
If I have money  
If I have children  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah Doo-wop a Doo-wah  
Summer skies and stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah Doo-wop a Doo-wah  
Summer skies and stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
  
We are standing in the sunlight  
The early morning sunlight  
In the harbor church of St. Cecilia  
To praise a soul's returning to the earth  
To the rose of Jericho and the Bougainvillea  
  
To prove that I love you  
Because I believe in you  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
If I have money  
If I have children  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
  
If I have weaknesses  
Don't let them blind me now  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah  
Doo Wop a Doo Wah  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
Leaving the shadow of the valley behind me now  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah  
Doo Wop a Doo Wah  
Summer skies and stars are falling  
All along the injured coast

Underoath,It's Dangerous Business Walking Out Your Front Door,"I've been up at this all night long  
I've been drowning in my sleep  
I've prayed for your safe place  
And its time for us to leave  
  
Time is running on empty and the gas is running out  
I've decided that tonight is the night  
That I set love aside  
Full speed ahead this seems to be the place  
I've seen this once before  
Planned perfection sought in my dreams  
Hoping this would take you home  
  
My knuckles have turned to white  
There's no turning back tonight  
So kiss me one last time  
  
Around this turn where the cross will cast your shadow  
The people will all gather  
To remember such a day where the flames grew as high  
As trees  
And the world stopped for you and me  
  
My knuckles have turned white  
There's no turning back tonight  
So hold on tight  
Kiss me one last time  
Shut your eyes  
  
I will now bring new meaning to the word alone  
Endless nights of dreaming of life  
And the days we should have spent here  
  
Drowning in my sleep I'm drowning in my sleep  
  
Glass shatters and comes to a halt  
I thought we'd be there by now  
I thought it would be so much quicker than this  
  
Pain has never been so brilliant  
I made sure you were buckled in  
Now you can walk hand in hand with him

Creating the storm  
War in the heavens  
Vengeance ignited  
Torment and tempest  
Attacks like a swarm  
  
Forged out of Flame  
From chaos to destiny  
Bringer of pain  
Forever undying

Ice cold and evil  
Taking no prisoners  
Dark prince of the world  
Humanity trembles  
Enslaving you sinners  
You can't beg for mercy  
For none will be saved  
The burden of sin  
Echoes the prophecy  
Ascending from hell  
Forever despising

Their faith is revealed  
Deceivers are crying  
By crucified steel  
Evangelising  
  
Judas is Rising  
Judas is Rising

Nazareth,Changin' Times,"When I was younger I used to understand  
That when you're with a girl, you gotta act like a man  
Mama told me that's the way it should be  
And I know my mama never lied to me.  
  
What do you think about you're changin' times  
Cause when I'm with you I just can't make up my mind  
Since I met you don't know right from wrong  
Somebody tell me just what's goin' on  
  
Just can't get myself thinkin' straight  
I'm all shook up and in a terrible state  
Sometimes I think I got it all figured out  
Then you do something new and it just knocks me right out  
  
Someday baby I'm going to have to make a stand  
The way that you treat me baby  
Don't make me feel too much like a man  
And baby, baby, the changes you're goin' through  
You're drivin' me half crazy  
Can't make up my mind what to do about you.  
  
Tellin' myself that time is on my side  
You're gettin' this feelin' that my mind's on the slide  
Dumped on the floor, I feel I'm trapped in a spin  
Don't know how to end, can't think of where to begin  
  
She don't care I know she don't even try  
But when she turns it on  
You know she gets me so high.  
  
She's a lady that's making my life a sin  
You know that I'm runnin' in a losin' race  
There ain't no way I can win  
Baby, baby, the changes you're goin' through  
They're drivin' me half crazy  
Can't make up my mind what to do about you.

Would love to love you  
And that she will cry  
When she learns we are two

I have to piece my life together  
Every time you're away  
In the heat of the day  
In the dark of the night  
Every time I turn the light  
I feel that God is not in heaven  
In the dark of the night  
The dark of the night  
  
I wonder why I live alone here  
I wonder why we spend these nights together  
Is this the room I'll live my life forever  
I wonder why in LA  
To live and die in LA  
  
I wonder why we waste our lives here  
When we could run away to paradise  
But I am held in some invisible vice  
And I can't get away  
To live and die in LA  
  
If I let myself go  
And for where I just don't know  
I'd maybe hit some cold new river  
That led out to the sea  
An unknown sea  
I'd either swim or I'd drown  
Or just keep falling down and down  
I think its that, that makes me quiver  
Just to keep falling down  
Down, down, down  
  
I wonder why I live alone here  
I wonder why we spend these nights together  
Is this the way I'll live my life forever  
I wonder why in LA  
To live and die in LA  
  
In every word that you say  
I feel my freedom slip away  
I feel the bars come down around me  
And I can't get away  
I can't get away  
  
I wonder why I live alone here  
I wonder why we spend these nights together  
Is this the room I'll live my life forever

Kenny Rogers,Slow Dance More,"Grady Johnson was a common man  
Four children and some bottom land

Hand in hand and side by side

Some folks have and some have not  
What really counts  
Is what you do with what you've got

When he said son what matters most  
You can count on just one hand

I wanna hide  
This is the part where I detach  
Each time they write a hateful word  
Dragging my soul into the dirt  
I wanna die  
Never [?] hurts

Just hold me while I cry my eyes out

But I'm in the dark, yeah  
I can't be superhero right now  
Even hearts made out of steel can break down  
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet  
I'm only human  
Anything they did to me, said to me  
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now  
Even when the world turns its back on me  
There could be a war but I'm not going down

One little lie can ruin my day  
Words are like weapons, they betray  
When I am afraid  
One word of kindness, it can save me

Being destructive is  
They couldn't say it to my face  
ONe day I won't care  
But for the moment I'm not there  
I'll just close my eyes and let you catch me now

There's no sun up in the sky  
An I cry so many time girl  
Just like a broken toy  
Oh I cannot stand the pain girl  
It was over, I can see  
And now you told me lady,  
there's a chance for you and me  
  
Just close your eyes - and stay with me  
There is a place - where I want to be with you  
Just close your eyes - take me in your heart  
I will love you pretty baby, if you try a start  
  
Did I ever ever told you  
That I dreamed of you last night  
Is there anything I can do  
cause I want to hold you tight  
Did I tell you I was dying  
When turned away from me  
Took away my sweet sweet heaven  
And I lost my destiny  
Oh I cannot stand the pain girl  
It is over, I can see  
And now you told me baby,  
There's a second chance for me

Gloria Estefan,Love On Layaway,"If I could only have one wish this holiday  
Without a second thought I'd have to say  
That you can't find what I want in any store  
I just want you to be mine and nothing more  
No brand new clothes could fill my lonely soul  
When the snow falls on the ground and it gets cold  
No expensive gift you put under my tree  
Will keep me warm this holiday if you're not holding me  
I don't want diamond rings, perfume or brand new shoes  
Baby all I want for Christmas is you  
  
Santa bring, on your sleigh, just for me this holiday  
The one I want and make my dreams come true  
I'll be good every day, I'll put some love on layaway  
And spend it all this Christmas on you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna put some love on layaway for you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna spend it all this Christmas on you  
  
If I could win your heart and show you how I feel  
Ain't no way you're gonna find a better deal  
I've been saving all my loving for so long  
And after Christmas is over it still keeps going on  
Everyday would be like Christmas from now on  
Santa bring that love to me where it belongs  
  
Santa bring, on your sleigh, just for me this holiday  
The one I want and make my dreams come true  
I'll be good every day, I'll put some love on layaway

Go lightly underground

Let me bring you where two roads meet

They may be shady, English roses  
Blue blooded, turned up noses  
  
Money talks, see what it catches  
Postage paid, no strings attached  
She's a honey, she's a tramp  
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps  
  
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me  
Wrap her up, she is all I need  
Wrap her up, I only get one chance  
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance  
  
Wrap her up, I'll taker her home with me  
Wrap her up, she is all I need  
Wrap her up  
Give her to me, wrap her up

Italian girls, take me to heaven  
You pretty babies, from Paris, France  
Crazy horses, love to dance

Fall Out Boy,Thriller,"[Jay Z]

But by fall we were a cover story, ""now in stores""  
Make us poster boys for your scene  
But we are not making an acceptance speech  
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes  
Every dot-com's refreshing for a journal update  
  
So long live the car-crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me and fortify  
  
So long live the car crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me and fortify  
  
I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave  
Of my hand 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am  
The only thing I haven't done yet is die  
And it's me and my plus-one at the afterlife  
Crowds are won and lost and won again  
But our hearts beat for the die-hards  
  
So long live the car-crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me in forty-five  
  
So long live the car-crash hearts

It got something to do with young men killing each other, Arthur  
What if its my turn, will you want me to go?  
For democracy, any man would give his only begotten son

When you can't even tell when your awake and when your asleep  
Where am I?

Can't tell if this is true or dream

This terrible silence stops with me

I'm waking up, I cannot see  
That there's not much left of me  
Nothing is real but pain now

Genesis,Domino--In The Glow Of The Night,"The grey of evening  
Fills the room  
No need to look outside  
To see or feel the rain  
I reach across to touch her  
But I know that she's not there  
Rain keeps running down the window pane  
Time keeps running out for me  
  
Can't you see what you are doing to me  
Can't you see what you have done  
As I try to pass another long and sleepless night  
As a hundred crazy voices call my name  
As I try to pass them by  
I almost can believe that she is here  
Here in the glow of the night  
  
Do you know what you have done  
Do you know what you've begun  
Do you see we shall never be together again  
All of my life  
  
All the lonely people, empty rooms  
And all the pointless violence, silent tombs  
Could it be that we shall be together again  
  
Sheets of double glazing  
Help to keep outside the night  
Only foreign city sirens can cut through  
Nylon sheets and blankets  
Help to minimize the cold  
But they can't keep out the chilling sounds  
Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming  
That she is here with me  
Here in the glow of the night  
  
Do you know what you have done  
Do you know what you've begun  
Do you see we shall never be together again  
All of my life  
  
All the lonely people, empty rooms  
And all the pointless violence, silent tombs  
Could it be that we shall be together again

George Jones,A Good Year For The Roses,"I can hardly bare the sight of lipstick  
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray  
Lyin' cold the way you left them  
At least your lips caressed them while you packed.  
  
And a lip print on a half filled cup of coffee  
That you poured and didn't drink  
But at least you thought you wanted it  
And that's so much more than I can say for me.  
  
[Chorus]  
But what a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there  
The lawn could stand another mowin'  
It's funny, I don't even care.  
And when you turned and walked away  
And as the door behind you closes  
The only thing I know to say  
It's been a good year for the roses.  
  
After three full years of marriage  
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed  
I guess the reason we're not talkin'  
There's so little left to say, we haven't said.  
  
While a million thoughts go runnin' through my mind  
I find I haven't spoke a word  
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds  
Of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard.  
  
[Chorus]

Tom T. Hall,High Steppin' Proud,"I was a high steppin' proud man one time king of the sidewalk fed all the
girls a line  
You came along and love laid a heavy hand on me  
High steppin' proud man went down to his knees  
For a while I enjoyed just bein' under your thumb  
But after a while the nerve of love grew numb  
Then I knew my heart was changing cryin' out long and loud  
To once again become a man high steppin' proud  
High steppin' proud man down on my knees  
Beckon to your every wish and your every need  
Oh I know it won't be long before I break those vows  
And once again become a man high steppin' proud  
[ 12str guitar ]  
There's a lot of things in life I'm glad I didn't miss  
And your good good love rates mighty high on the list  
But my restless spirit and a weddin' band don't get along somehow  
Especially since I long to be high steppin' proud  
High steppin' proud man...

Pretenders,Day After Day,"Way up in the sky  
Over the city, over Tokyo  
Silver light, summer moon  
You'll be over somebody's winter this afternoon  
While the dolphins swim in the sea  
You're going grey, my baby  
Still the war is waging endlessly  
Day after day, day after day  
  
Way up in the sky  
Over the city and lake Erie  
You remember the flats, you were there  
Out every night Mr. Moonlight  
  
Round and round and round we go  
Just like yesterday  
  
Way up in the sky  
Over the city where you sleep tonight  
The light outside your window blinks  
""Hotel, hotel, hotel""  
Open the blind and dream in a moonbeam  
  
When the war's finally over  
We'll meet again  
And pick up where we left off

What I have, lost intentions  
Two by two coming through the door

Boys and girls voices joined in song

Fire crackers making so much noise  
(Flying in the air)  
They all start yelling at me

I'm not the same boy I was before  
But I've not changed my desires  
I've not extinguished the fires  
I haven't lost wide eyed wonder  
I haven't lost, haven't lost, haven't lost  
The stupid fear of thunder  
Two by two walking hand in hand  
(Walkin' in the air)  
The bone come marching from the promised land  
(Comes from everywhere)  
Their voices carry like the sound of glass  
(Breaking on the ground)  
It burns my ears when they sing  
. . . . . Everything you do is wrong  
I'm not the same ghost I was before  
But I still converse with the spirits  
When people talk I don't hear it  
I walk through doors when no one sees me  
I disappear, I disappear, disappear  
Whenever it may please me

Down sunset to the beach  
Though Canoga Park is a straight safe drive  
It's too far outta reach  
But now the headlights are flashin' by so fast  
All directions seems the same  
And the windscreen wipers keep a beat repeatin'  
You can't let go again  
What's in a name on the street tonight  
I'm only a face in the crowd  
All in the dark and afraid tonight  
Nowhere to run or to hide  
But I can't let go  
Sometimes the world outside'll take you in  
With just a smile  
And you so blinded with desire  
A hundred sleepless nights have left me  
Wasted and so cold

We're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Stupid fight  
Baby girl we're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Staying made at me for eternity  
What's that gonna fix  
So baby can we try  
Cause what we've got is so much bigger than this

Fleetwood Mac,I Got It In For You,"Baby I've been your shadow  
I'm on your heels both night and day  
Baby I'm getting warmer  
I'm getting closer, inches away  
I've been watching every move you make  
And I've got feelings overdue  
  
I got it in for you  
(I got it in for you)  
I got it in for you

I've been runnin' under cover  
In the darkness of the night

You will see me out of sight  
Now I'm moving into your light  
I think it's high time you knew

(I got it in for you)  
Don't want to do without  
(I got it in for you)

Over and over  
I got it in for you  
(I got it in for you)  
I got it in for you

Baby don't you worry  
You won't be lonely anymore  
Baby I've been planning  
All the romance you're looking for  
And it's right outside your door  
And tonight I'm comin' through  
  
I got it in for you  
(I got it in for you)  
I got it in for you

Clash,Lover's Rock,"Yeh, you must treat your lover girl right  
If you want to make lover's rock  
You must know a place you can kiss to make lovers rock  
'Cause everybody knows it's a crying shame  
But nobody knows the poor baby's name  
When she forgot that thing that she had to swallow  
  
You Western man, you're free with your seed  
When you make lovers rock  
But woops! there goes the strength that you need  
To make real cool lovers rock  
'Cause a genuine lover takes off his clothes  
And he can make a lover in a thousand go's  
An' she don't need that thing that she had to swallow

Whitney Houston,I Didn't Know My Own Strength,"Lost touch with my soul  
I had no where to turn  
I had no where to go  
Lost sight of my dream,  
  
Thought it would be the end of me  
I thought I'd never make it through  
I had no hope to hold on to,  
I thought I would break  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
And I crashed down, and I tumbled  
But I did not crumble  
I got through all the pain  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
Survived my darkest hour  
My faith kept me alive  
I picked myself back up  
  
Hold my head up high  
I was not built to break  
I didn't know my own strength  
  
Found hope in my heart,  
I found the light to life  
My way out the dark  
Found all that I need  
Here inside of me  
  
I thought I'd never find my way  
I thought I'd never lift that weight  
I thought I would break  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
And I crashed down, and I tumbled  
But I did not crumble  
I got through all the pain  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
Survived my darkest hour  
My faith kept me alive  
I picked myself back up  
  
Hold my head up high  
I was not built to break  
I didn't know my own strength  
  
There were so many times I  
Wondered how I'd get through the night I  
Thought took all I could take  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
And I crashed down, and I tumbled  
But I did not crumble  
I got through all the pain  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
Survived my darkest hour  
My faith kept me alive  
I picked myself back up  
  
Hold my head up high  
I was not built to break  
I didn't know my own strength

Saying lots of things

But you won't get me

Liquor store and rodeos  
P I X and rock and roll  
The freckled face the thin and fat  
The drive-in films and drive-in macs  
  
Strip and porno neon signs  
Where's the building where am I  
  
Buckingham Palace trains all late  
Funny little men all out in the rain  
Car front deals and after pubs  
Tenth year plays and seedy clubs  
  
Iffy people don't seem to mind  
Where's the action where am I

Sunny days, where have you gone?

Why does it always rain on me?

I can't avoid the lightning

I'm being held up by an invisible man  
Still life on a shelf when  
I got my mind on something else

She'll only give to others the love that she's gotten from you  
Don't let her know  
Don't let her know where you're going  
Don't untie the ties that bind

Marillion,Fantastic Place,"Islands are mountain-tops  
  
It's always a struggle  
To let somebody go  
It's a natural desire  
To own your lover, I know  
  
And you can screw a man down  
Until he takes to drinking  
He'll give you all of his money  
You still won't know what he's thinking  
  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
  
Take me to the island  
I'll watch the rain over your shoulder  
The streetlights in the water  
The moment outside of real life  
  
I never could dream while I was sleeping  
Put your arms around my soul  
And take it dancing..  
  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
  
Take me to the island  
I'll watch the rain over your shoulder  
The streetlights on the wet stone  
The moment outside of real life  
  
Say you understand me  
And I will leave myself completely  
Forgive me if I stare  
But I can see the island behind your tired, troubled eyes  
  
Take me to the island  
I'll tell you all I never told you  
The boy I never showed you  
More than I gave in my life  
Take me by the hand  
You'll either kill me or you'll save me  
Take me to the island  
Show me what might be real life

Yello,Night Flanger,"I wake up in the evening  
The sun is still around  
The street seems to be busy  
I hear the traffic sounds  
  
Last night's been lousy  
I had a lot to drink  
Too many dry martinis  
And cans of beer to sink  
  
Another day, already night  
Blue neon light  
Blue neon light  
  
I could call my Rhianna  
Ask her to meet me now  
I think I lost her number  
It's too late anyhow  
I could turn on the TV  
Or I could stay in bed  
  
These Asians drive me crazy  
These Asians drive me mad  
  
Another day, already night  
Blue neon light  
Blue neon light  
  
Night is near  
I'm still in bed  
Red curtain  
Soft wind  
Sunlight  
And I was red  
  
On the papers  
On the floor  
We did watch possessed  
  
People, push and pull it  
Moss turf, and other lads  
My head's still full of poison  
What I do is insane  
I should, perhaps, move out of here  
Or take a plane to Spain  
  
Refrigerator's noise  
I'll get out, the only choice  
Should I get up right now  
Wait for me somehow  
Don't want to know what for  
To get out of this door  
Should I phone Debbie Meier?  
Is this the one desire?  
I look into the mirror  
My eyes can't be in error  
The sun's now really gone  
Perhaps I am the one  
Nothing can creep in sight  
I'm turning on the lights  
  
Turning on the lights  
I'm turning on the lights (5x)  
  
The sun's now really gone  
Perhaps I am the one

I'm tired of living day-to-day and hand-to-mouth  
This could be the day I finally find my way out  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna climb that mountain high  
I'm gonna see what's on the other side  
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye  
I'm gonna climb that mountain  
  
How I arrived here, heaven only knows  
Seems more like the kind of place the devil would've chose  
To spend my life here, is more than I can do  
I know somewhere down the road my dream will come true  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I stay here forever  
What will I have to show  
But if I make it over  
Then everyone will know  
I'm gonna climb that mountain high

Joni Mitchell,The Priest,"The priest sat in the airport bar  
He was wearing his father's tie  
And his eyes looked into my eyes so far  
Whenever the words ran dry  
Behind the lash and the circles blue  
He looked as only a priest can, through  
And his eyes said me and his eyes said you  
And my eyes said, let us try  
  
He said, ""You wouldn't like it here  
No it's no place you should share  
The roof is ripped with hurricanes  
And the room is always bare  
I need the wind and I seek the cold""  
He reached post the wine for my hand to hold  
And he saw me young and he saw me old  
And he saw me sitting there  
  
Then he took his contradictions out  
And he splashed them on my brow  
So which words was I then to doubt  
When choosing what to vow  
Should I choose them all-should I make them mine  
The sermons, the hymns and the valentines  
And he asked for truth and he asked for time  
And he asked for only now  
Now the trials are trumpet scored  
Oh will we pass the test  
Or just as one loves more and more  
Will one love less and less  
Oh come let's run from this ring we're in  
Where the Christians clap and the Germans grin  
Saying let them lose, crying let them win  
Oh make them both confess

Gino Vannelli,A New Fix For '76,"And now that psychedelia's gone when the hell ya gonna face reality boy  
We can't be that asinine to think that nineteen sixty nine was the way it
should be  
There's a new moon with an old shine  
So it's time to open your heart as wide as you see  
Sing a new song of mobility  
Get a new fix for seventy six  
And now whether our hair's short or long  
The issue is not really if it's right or wrong  
But as long as it's clean .... right  
I've gotta realize that our new found philosophies  
Were only synthesized in the delusion of a flower child scene  
There's a new star in an old space  
So it's time you open your soul and set yourself free  
Sing a new song of totality  
Get a new fix for seventy six  
So we thought we were cool and free  
But then our heros blew their minds  
With X and why's and LSD oh what a sin  
Friend we gotta comprehend and we gotta learn from the past  
And not dwell in it again and again and again  
Hold one hand with time  
And open your mind naturally  
Sing a new song of vitality  
Get a new fix for seventy six

Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.

Warm as the mountain sunshine  
On the edge of the snow line  
In a meadow of columbine.  
  
Oh little Jennifer, I'd give a penny for  
What you got on your mind.  
Seems like most of the time you're lyin' there dreamin'.  
Maybe in your visions you've seen how omniscient is  
Slightly less than divine.  
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.  
  
Ripplin' water's flowin' through the pipes  
In the walls that are keepin' me warm.  
The closest I've been to my family for days is my music.  
Silently starin' at the mornin' sky  
It's just like hearin' her callin' my name.  
Cut the telephone line and the story might change.  
  
And oh, like a bubble on a windy day  
I start to flutter when I hear you say  
That you feel to good to go away.  
And you make me feel fine.  
And you make my world

Death defying mayhem volume  
Screaming through the stacks  
Stop and stare at the demons lair  
Burning so fast  
You won't last  
Crazed in sweat and blasphemy  
But still we cannot hear  
Legions rise, fell their eyes  
You live in fear  
You came to jeer  
Don't dicatate to us  
We were the first  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud  
Souls of ninety thousand fold  
Are only steps away  
In the night, flames alight  
Until that day, were here to stay  
Blackened power metal marches  
Through the gates of Hades  
Weak and blind we leave behind  
Bring down the lights  
Inject the ice

Too loud for the crowd

Than let you change my mind  
And I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun

Some who never let you down  
Some who fail you every day  
And it's a blatant disrespect of privacy  
It amazes me

And if you should leave I hope you see  
I won't be around baby if you shoud leave  
You're gonna need me  
  
You might think that leaving is easy  
I had no right to lead you on  
I should have told you the moment the feeling was gone  
What I'm trying to say is that I need some space,  
I need to be sure  
  
No, you'll never find another love like me  
All around this world  
Still you tell me

Tom Jones,A Woman's Touch,"Right from the first day one man stood alone  
And somehow he missed what didn't exist how could he have known  
He looked all around him and lifted his head  
For he heard a voice and rose to rejoice as somebody said  
  
This place needs a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a woman's touch  
Life don't mean much to a man  
  
Up through the ages, the story's the same  
A king to himself, alone with his wealth is living in vain  
His castle will crumble and he'll wonder why  
'Cause wealthy or poor, there's one thing for sure, he just can't deny  
  
The need of a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a woman's touch  
Life don't mean much to a man  
  
I was a drifter who couldn't be tamed  
So reckless and wild but lost like a child  
Whose dreams never came  
  
Then I felt the pleasures of love's happiness  
One look in her eyes and I realized  
I've truly been blessed  
  
Thank God for a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my woman's touch  
To make me feel like a man  
  
Thank God for a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my woman's touch  
To make me feel like a man

Eagles,Learn To Be Still,"It's just another day in paradise

We don't know how to be alone  
So we wander 'round this desert  
And wind up following the wrong gods home  
But the flock cries out for another  
And they keep answering that bell  
And one more starry-eyed messiah  
Meets a violent farewell-

Learn to be still  
  
Now the flowers in your garden  
They don't smell so sweet  
Maybe you've forgotten  
The heaven lying at your feet  
  
There are so many contradictions  
In all these messages we send  
(We keep asking)  
How do I get out of here  
Where do I fit in?  
Though the world is torn and shaken  
Even if your heart is breakin'  
It's waiting for you to awaken  
And someday you will-

Learn to be still

Keep on runnin'

Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on.  
I'll come in on my part on a fast song.  
Dideldiedie...  
  
Well it don't have to have a banjo or mandelin  
But let it in, if it wants in.  
Keep the rosin' handed and the horse there tough and tight.  
Pick it up and I'm lyable to pick all night.  
Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune,  
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome tune.  
Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on.  
I'll come in on my part on a fast song.

You're always running in place

You're always beggin' me for a taste  
But I ain't up to snuff if you sneeze

Has so many friends  
He wags his tail instead of his tongue

She likes to grab my microphone  
Now there ain't too much she won't do  
Especially when we're all alone  
  
You're up, you're down  
You're always runnin' in place  
Triathlon if you please  
Her mind's on rewind and erase  
You might get shot, babe  
When you're shootin' the breeze  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me bends  
You're heads and tails  
Are calling for love

Your older sister  
She's a lot like you  
And there ain't too much she won't do  
  
There's always something

I lose my mind and then I surely fade away, yeah  
  
Yak yak yak

You're heads and tails

Depeche Mode,Leave In Silence,"I've told myself so many times before  
But this time I think I mean it for sure  
We have reached a full stop  
Nothing's gonna save us from the big drop  
Reached our natural conclusion  
Outlived the illusion  
I hate being in these situations  
That call for diplomatic relations  
If I only knew the answer  
Or I thought we had a chance  
Or I could stop this  
I would stop this thing from spreading like a cancer  
What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore  
What can I say? I'm heading for the door  
I can't stand this emotional violence  
Leave in silence  
We've been running around in circles all year  
Doing this and that and getting nowhere  
This'll be the last time  
(I think I said that last time)  
If I only had a potion,  
Some magical lotion  
That could stop this, I would stop this  
I would set the wheels in motion  
What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore  
What can I say? I'm heading for the door  
I can't stand this emotional violence  
Leave in silence

Jim Croce,Lover's Cross,"Guess that it was bound to happen  
Was just a matter of time  
But now I've come to my decision  
And it's a-one of the painful kind  
'Cause now it seems that you wanted a martyr  
Just a regular guy wouldn't do  
But baby I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you  
  
Yes, I really got to hand it to you  
'Cause girl you really tried  
But for ev'ry time that we spent laughin'  
There were two times that I cried  
And you were tryin' to make me your martyr  
And that's the one thing I just couldn't do  
'Cause baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you  
  
'Cause tables are meant for turnin'  
And people are bound to change  
And bridges are meant for burnin'  
When the people and mem'ries they join aren't the same  
  
So I'll hope that you can find  
Another who can take what I could not  
He'll have to be a super guy  
Or maybe a super god  
'Cause I never was much of a martyr before  
And I ain't 'bout to start nothin' new  
And baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you

Save me, save me, save me  
  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
Drowning in tears from my heart that's hurting  
Drowning in tears from a love that's uncertain  
  
I'm lost in a world without love, a sea of emptiness  
The love we knew is being washed away  
Don't think I can last, my heart is sinking fast  
  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
Trying to hold on to a love that's mine  
Drowning in the love that keeps me grieving  
Drowning in the fear that my arms you're leaving  
  
Bring back that love we knew  
Darling let me live again  
A little tenderness to me start showing  
Fill my heart with love till it's overflowing  
  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
Trying to hold on to a love that's gone  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
So won't you save this heart of mine  
  
Going down, down for the third time  
Going down, down for the third time  
I'm like a ship all alone on a raging sea  
You got me tossing and a turning  
And I can't get free  
  
Reach out your hand for me  
Darling, save what's left of our love  
I'll forgive your lies and alibi's  
If you'll wipe my crying eyes  
  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
So won't you save this heart of mine  
I've loved too long, I love too strong  
Now little boy you know you're doing me wrong  
  
Come on and save me  
Come on and save me  
Come on and save me  
I'm going down, down for the third time

From sweet sweet chariots

And I swear I'm half way there

Jackson Browne,Everywhere I Go,"I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When we're apart I can hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
People say that I must be in love  
The way I forget what we're speaking of  
The way I stand there smiling straight ahead  
And walk away without hearing a word they said  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When we're apart I can close my eyes and hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
In the middle of the football game  
At the beach in the pouring rain  
Standing on a hillside staring at the sun  
People hurry by the unfortunate one  
With the faraway eyes and the mystery smile  
Moving my body in a ragamuffin style  
I can't sit down when I hear it start  
I hear your heart everywhere I go  
  
People say that I must be a fool  
Cause when I'm near you I cannot be cool  
I don't quite make sense when I talk to you  
And when you smile I forget everything I knew  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When we're apart I can close my eyes and hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
Standing in the market where I buy my bread  
With a hunger in my belly and a rhythm in my head  
Looking all around for something good to eat  
Between the butter and the beans and the mops and the meat  
Coffee from the mountain, honey from the bee  
Nothing tastes as good as you taste to me  
Rocking in the aisle to my inside song  
People staring at me think I got a Walkman on  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
I hear your heart  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
I hear your heart  
Beating everywhere I go

ABBA,When I Kissed The Teacher,"Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher  
And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher  
All my friends at school  
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool  
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise  
When I kissed the teacher  
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher  
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher  
Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry  
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher  
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled

Bruce Springsteen,Cross My Heart,"First time I crossed my heart  
I was begging baby please  
At your bedside  
Down on my knees  
When I crossed my heart  
When I crossed my heart  
I crossed my heart,  
Pretty baby over you  
  
Second time I crossed my heart  
Rain came in from the south  
I was lying there with something sweet and salty in my mouth  
When I crossed my heart  
When I crossed my heart  
When I crossed my heart, pretty darling over you.  
  
Well you may think the world's black and white  
And you're dirty or you're clean, son  
You better watch out you don't slip  
Through them spaces in between  
  
Well the night gets sticky  
And the sky gets black  
I grabbed you baby, and you grabbed me back  
And we crossed our hearts  
Mmm we crossed our hearts  
Yeah, I crossed my heart  
Mmmhmmmhmmmm  
  
Well little boys little girls  
Hell they don't know wrongs from their rights,  
And once you cross your heart, you ain't ever supposed to lie  
Well life ain't nothing but a cold, hard ride  
I ain't leaving til I'm satisfied.  
I cross my heart  
Yeah I cross my heart  
Well I cross my heart  
Pretty darling over you  
  
Oohoooohoooh

Vince Gill,O Holy Night,"O holy night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
  
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth  
A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine, o night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night, O night divine  
O night divine, O night, O night divine

Cyndi Lauper,Hymn To Love,"If the sky should fall into the sea  
And the stars fade all around me  
All the times that we have known here  
I will sing a hymn to love  
  
We have lived and dreamed we two alone  
In a world that's been our very own  
With it's memories ever grateful  
Just for you I sing a hymn to love  
  
I remember each embrace  
The smile that lights your face  
And my heart begins to sing  
Your eyes have never lied  
And my heart begins to sing  
And my heart begins to sing  
  
If one day you should ever disappear  
Always remember these words  
If one day we had to say goodbye  
And our love should fade away and die  
In my heart you will remain here  
And I'II sing a hymn to love  
  
O for love, we live eternally  
In the blue we'll roll this harmony  
With every day we are in heaven  
As for you, I'll sing a hymn to love  
  
Don't you ever worry, dear  
And the stars shall fade from the sky  
All the times that we have known here  
I will sing a hymn to our love  
Oh darling,  
Just for you I sing  
A hymn to love

Rush,The Weapon,"We've got nothing to fear...but fear itself?  
Not pain, not failure, not fatal tragedy?  
Not the faulty units in this mad machinery?  
Not the broken contacts in emotional chemistry?  
With an iron fist in a velvet glove  
We are sheltered under the gun  
In the glory game on the power train  
Thy kingdom's will be done  
And the things that we fear are a weapon to be held against us  
He's not afraid of your judgment  
He knows of horrors worse than your Hell  
He's a little bit afraid of dying  
But he's a lot more afraid of your lying  
And the things that he fears are a weapon to be held against him  
Can any part of life be larger than life?  
Even love must be limited by time  
And those who push us down that they might climb  
Is any killer worth more than his crime?  
Like a steely blade in a silken sheath  
We don't see what they're made of  
They shout about love, but when push comes to shove  
They live for the things they're afraid of  
And the knowledge that they fear is a weapon to be used against them

Alice Cooper,Make That Money (Scrooge's Song),"When I was a boy  
I never played with toys  
Never had a friend  
Never laughed or cried much  
And when I was a boy  
My father was a man  
With a strict and sturdy hand  
No soft touch  
  
Make that money, make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
Gotta make that money  
Make that money, listen sonny  
Learn to sting before your stung  
  
Now that I'm a man  
Every penny has been planned  
I'm financially grand  
And perfectly greedy  
Sentimental fools  
I make all your rules  
I've got your cash, got your jewels  
They're all mortgaged to me  
  
Make that money, make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
Gotta make that money  
Make that money, listen sonny  
Learn to sting before your stung  
  
And I know  
'Cause he told me so  
Told me so I believe him  
I still believe...  
Give me that money  
  
Controlling all your cash  
I could make you live in trash  
I eat pheasant, you eat hash  
No philanthropy  
But when it's time for me to croak  
Bury me with all my dough  
And where there should've been an oak  
My private money tree will grow  
  
Make that money  
Said make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
  
Told me so  
Told me so  
He told me so

David Bowie,Bombers,"[Chorus]  
All clear wail the sirens  
Sunshine on the wasteland  
Old man sitting in the white sand  
Think we're in for a big surprise  
Right between the eyes  
  
Seemed a good idea  
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here  
Only one man could be seen  
And he was old and so serene  
Captain sat in his deck chair  
And the red light flashed Beware  
Pilot felt quite big-time  
As the bomb sailed through the air  
Well, they danced and sang  
When the bang went bang  
When the lights popped out  
And the smoke began to clear  
It was positively queer  
  
[Chorus]  
  
""Die"" said the General  
""Cobblers"" said the man  
So the Pentagon sent a cable  
And the Queen a telegram  
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones  
Ripped apart that sand  
'Til the stench was just revolting  
And the sky a greenish tan  
But the soldier said ""Sir,  
There's a crack in the world""  
And the figures went ""squash"",  
And the bits flew far and wide  
How the universe sighed!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When the smoke had blown away  
There was nothing left to view  
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you  
Floating high up in the sky

Fleetwood Mac,I Wonder Why,"It's hard  
When a love goes wrong  
Picking up the pieces to go on  
Our dreams  
Are scattered in the wind  
I won't let it take me under  
Even though you tried...and...  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
Why people lie, and break a heart in two  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
It's strange  
Strange the way I feel  
Time is all I need to make me heal  
You're gone  
And now I'm all alone (now you're all alone)  
I'll reclaim the thunder  
Dry the tears I've cried...still...  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
Why people lie, and break a heart in two  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
Now I'm turning my back on confusion  
I won't live in a world of illusion  
Well the river stopped running through me  
You didn't see what you did to me  
I've got to try to find, some kind of peace of mind  
You're just a mystery to me  
I'll reclaim the thunder  
Dry the tears I've cried...still...  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
Why people lie, and break a heart in two  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do

Eric Clapton,It's In The Way That You Use It,"[Chorus:]  
It's in the way that you use it,  
It comes and it goes.  
It's in the way that you use it,  
Boy don't you know.  
  
And if you lie you will lose it,  
Feelings will show.  
So don't you ever abuse it,  
Don't let it go.  
  
Nobody's right till somebody's wrong.  
Nobody's weak till somebody's strong.  
No one gets lucky till luck comes along.  
Nobody's lonely till somebody's gone.

And if you lie you will lose it,  
Feelings will show.  
So don't you ever abuse it,  
Don't let it go.

Walked on some thin ice, never like this.  
I've told you white lies, never like this.  
Looked into true eyes, never like this.

Take you and your blade and break you both

That's hard to see on an evening such as this  
For they give the very same sensation  
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss  
  
Your lips are much too close to mine  
Beware, my foolish heart  
But should our eager lips combine  
Then let the fire start  
For this time it isn't fascination  
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, it's love

Kid Rock,Cramp Ya Style,"(Kid Rock) Everything I do gonna be funny  
  
New Player on the field so yield and get back  
To the wall  
'Cause I'm playin' ya all  
Like a game  
  
K-I-D is the name  
Some complain  
And they got a little fame  
And it's a shame  
  
For what its worth  
I'm down with earth  
Pourin' it on like Ms. Butterworth  
Rich and thick  
  
Kinda quick not slow  
The rhymes I fit into flow  
All in a row, from the intro  
To the end so, ho  
  
Put down the microphone and go  
Step a side as I make room to bloom  
Any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb  
As soon as I grip the mic to get loose  
  
Don't dispute 'cause ya got no juice  
Meanwhile I kick a rhyme from the pile  
Huh, As I Cramp your style (style...style)  
  
Cramp your style (Cramp your style...cramp your style)  
  
Get down on your knees and pray when I break you  
Down with a sound  
Comin' down with a pound  
Or a bang  
  
If you can't hang with the slang  
That I exploit  
Comin' straight from Detroit  
Rough without a doubt or a question  
  
Kid Rock here in the flesh  
And addressin' and defining certain issues  
To diss you (he diss me..aheo)  
So wipe the tears from your eyes  
  
You can't hide so don't be surprised  
When I dismiss you from your throne  
And send you home  
As a Kid Rock clone  
  
'Cause I can hold my own  
Like ya hold a milkbone  
Simple as this with a grip that won't quit  
So when I hit the skit  
  
That's it  
So don't come in face with the base  
And remember your just an imitation  
Don't get buckwhile  
  
In fact don't smile  
'Cause I'll pull your file  
As I Cramp your style (style...style)  
  
Cramp your style (cramp your style...cramp your style)  
I'll claim the boundries of my domain  
Detroit...Detroit  
Fresh, I'm from the Midwest  
  
From MoTown...From MoTown  
  
I'm like steel or concrete yo cause I'm the hardest  
Down with a label known to be the largest  
Not bein modest don't even think of tryin to hang  
'Cause yo Kid Rock rolls like a Stop O  
  
I roll thick  
I roll heavy  
D-Nice justs keeps the pace steady  
So get ready to feel the pain  
  
I'm Kid Rock drivin' girls insane  
So listen rappers and get to the program  
Breakin' ya down is the Kid rock slogan  
And any rapper who thinks about dissin'  
  
You know what I'll say?  
I got a great big dick  
So anyone who can't adjust  
Gets rust  
  
And then bites the dust  
Be ready to walk a mile  
'Cause I'll smack that cool-Aid smile  
As I Cramp your style (style...style)  
Cramp your style (cramp your style...cramp your style)

No, I don't want to be just another

Something that I really need  
Everyone I know  
Someone that i want to be.

I don't really know  
I better pick it up  
Before I let it slip away  
I better stick it out  
Before I take another day.  
  
Into now  
Every word I say, fades out.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can only open up your eyes  
When the clouds break  
Can only feel alive  
Even though the world shakes.  
  
Every night  
You're in my quiet, sateen, light.  
Can I hold you close  
To a rather full moon kiss.  
  
Everything I know  
I don't even know who it is  
  
It all falls through  
I'm here and I hear you.

Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
'Cause I need to, just to reach you  
Can you hear me?  
Coming clearly?  
Am I hollow?  
Just an echo?

Echo-ooo  
(Do you hear me?) We come and we go  
(Hello?) No, I don't want to be just another

It's just another day  
And every single word I say, fades out.

Waylon Jennings,Another Man's Fool,"Don't sing them songs about the open road  
I lost too many rainbows chasing pots of gold  
I still remember what my baby said  
It's still a knockin' around in back of my head  
  
[Chorus]  
She said, I'm gonna lock the doors around about midnight  
Put bars on the window like a zoo  
You ain't the man that reaches up to turn out my light  
You're just another man's fool  
Just another man's fool  
  
I left this morning had just one more chance  
She caught me leaving by the seat of my pants  
She said go on get out and have a good time  
Don't bother coming home if you can't bring me mine

I know what they mean  
I'm walking in the wasteland  
With the Ghost in the Machine  
There's a simulated sunset  
Starlight in my eyes  
The skies are filled with miracles  
And half of them are lies  
Are you real or not?  
It's a fine line  
Are you ready or not  
For the light of day  
Are you real or not?  
These are strange times  
And I don't want to live this way  
When you wake up from a nightmare  
And it's worse when you're awake  
And there's no one you can turn to  
And there's nothing you can take  
Are you real or not?  
It's a fine line  
Are you ready or not  
For the light of day ?  
Are you real or not?  
These are strange times  
And I don't want to live this way

Started to move

And you smiled like an angel  
Fallen from heaven, oh -  
Just to be lifted up again, ohh  
  
And you kissed my lips  
With those once cold fingertips  
You brought me back to life

Slowly we fall asleep  
And never wake up again, oh oh ohh

Tim McGraw,Things Change,"They wouldn't let him play the Opry  
With whiskey on his breath

To figure out what they missed  
He went down that lost highway  
Underneath the purple sky  
A legend disappeared before his time  
Things change  
  
They said he was the devil  
Dressed in gold lame  
The way he shook his hips  
Out there on that stage  
But before that faithful day  
He left Tennessee  
All of them were calling him the king

Well they like to call them hippies  
Outlaws with guitars  
But they brought a little poetry  
To the honky tonks and bars

They might have flew a little too high  
Somewhere somebody's playing their song tonight

Now some say it's too country  
Some say it's a little rock n roll

It doesn't really matter  
It's always been the same  
Life goes on

Eminem,Bagpipes From Baghdad,"Oh! It's music to my ears, Oh man!  
How can I describe, the way I feel?  
Fuckin great man! Okay, let me see  
How could I begin  
  
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch,  
Was red wine, more red wine, and Captain Crunch,  
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch,  
And to soak it up and in between snack, crackers to munch,  
Mariah, what's ever happened to us, why did we have to break up,  
All I asked for was a glass of punch,  
You see, I never really ask for much,  
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such,  
A nasty breakup with that Latin hunk,  
Weisman Gale, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up,  
I'm not playin, I want to bag ya punk,  
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk,  
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rappin pump,  
Zappin Eric Clapton, (Shaft?), Frank Zappa crunk,  
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya,  
You can beat me with any spatula thatcha want,  
I mean I really want you bad you cunt,  
Nick you had your fun,  
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk,  
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood,  
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupunc-ture  
  
[Chorus]  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sake he's crazy, to say the least  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a glad-,  
  
You can be a permanent fixture,  
In my lyrical mixture,  
I'm the miracle whit trixter,  
My sig-nature sound, when the tube of lipstick's around,  
I'm bound to put on in an instant, wow  
Man what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma-  
Ceuticals, it's beautiful, pill dust in my palm, my  
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle,  
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama,  
I'll cut you like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya,  
The size of a sword boy, I'm like a fucken Red Sonia,  
Get it stuck in your cornea,  
Nice knowin ya Norman,  
You're so fuckin' annoyin,  
Drop the shovel boy, you don't know what the fuck ya doin',  
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more,  
Nick Cannon you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin whore,  
Every minute there's a sucker born,  
Snuck up on Malachai and made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn,  
Shuck of, shuck of corn, shuck of corn,  
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucken on,  
What the fuck are you doin',  
You're runnin' over the snow blower,  
With the lawnmower, blow on your  
Bagpipes from Baghdad

In the bed with two braindead lesbian vegetables,  
I bet you they become heterosexual,  
Nothing will stop me from molesting you,  
Tittyfucking you til your breasticle  
Flesh, tickles my testicles,  
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins,  
How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend,  
You need some ointment, just make an appointment,  
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip  
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip,  
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get  
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins wit  
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip,  
I'm going to get the needle, new thread from the sewing kit,  
An attempt to seperate em and stitch em back at the loin shit,

And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad  
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall  
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call  
  
He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride  
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied  
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand  
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne  
  
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name  
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim  
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand  
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne  
  
They never found her body, just her diary by the bed  
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said  
When he told her he was ridin' she said, 'Then I don't give a damn  
If you never come back from Cheyenne?  
  
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name  
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim  
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand  
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne  
  
Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive  
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night  
And if you go down by the water, you'll see her footprints in the sand

You's a breath of fresh air in this world of shit  
You was born to be a soldier don't ever forget  
Hit back when hit  
Use force that's effective  
All these bitches and women  
Son, please be selective  
This is California can't stick your dick in everything  
We will survive necessarily by any means  
Let no man ever hold you down or suppress you  
It's the 90's the police just arrest you,  
disrespect you on occasion take life  
By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight  
It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us  
When your neck is on the line stand ground then bust  
In God we trust but just in case keep it loaded and locked  
Ready to rock  
Then shake the spot  
The Foundation  
  
You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers  
Who forever smoke bud  
So it's probably in your blood  
Realize you can only run the streets so long  
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone  
It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong  
Same shit different day  
It's the same ol' song  
If the time ever comes that I meet my match  
Take control of my assets  
Fuck startin' from scratch  
Take care of your mother  
Keep yourself on track  
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back  
Beware of the serpent  
Cause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike  
And try to make you loose sight  
Don't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real  
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill  
Son if you ever pull heat  
Then use it  
If you got a chance to walk away  
Then do it  
Total domination takes full concentration in all situations  
A solid foundation  
  
You are the foundation  
Beginning of a new generation  
I remember hospital hallway pacin'  
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine  
Only to find that yours looked like mine  
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time  
In this life you can't press stop  
Then press rewind  
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man  
Have your own plan, expand your mind  
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs  
This is nothing but love  
Via satellite Mug gs  
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life  
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife  
Be prepared for the worst  
But expect the best  
No matter where life takes you  
Come home to the West  
Survival takes more than just gats and guns  
That's words to live by  
From a father to a son

It's Too Late Now, It's Time To Kiss The Rainbow  
Goodbye.  
Poison Tears Running From A Palsied Face,  
Satan Nears, Descending On The Human Race.  
Think You're God, Don't You Wish You Had Control,  
Think You're Loved But There's No One There At All...  
Chorus  
Listen To The Wind, Hear The Gospel Blow.  
Tell Me That You Don't Hear What I'm Hearing  
And I Will Let You Go.  
Look Up To The Sky, Put Your Trust In Me,  
Tell Me That You Ain't Feelin What I'm Feelin And I  
Will Set You Free.  
Look Into The Flame, See The Embers Glow,  
Tell Me That You Don't See What I'm Seein And I  
Will Let You Go  
Taste The Holy Blood, Running From My Veins  
Tell Me That You Ain't Feelin What I'm Feelin And  
I'll Take Away The Pain  
Yes I Will Now, Oh Yes I Will, It's Time To Kiss The  
Rainbow Goodbye.

Dolly Parton,Coat Of Many Colors,"Back through the years  
I go wanderin' once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us  
And how my momma put the rags to use  
There were rags of many colors  
Every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat  
And it was way down in the fall  
Momma sewed the rags together  
Sewin' every piece with love  
She made my coat of many colors  
That I was so proud of  
As she sewed, she told a story  
From the bible, she had read  
About a coat of many colors  
Joseph wore and then she said  
I hope this coat will bring you  
Good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And momma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colors  
That my momma made for me  
Made only from rags  
But I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
  
So with patches on my britches  
And holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
And my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
  
And oh I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love  
My momma sewed in every stitch  
And I told 'em all the story  
Momma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor  
Only if they choose to be  
Now I know we had no money  
But I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
Made just for me

Gordon Lightfoot,Stay Loose,"If you've got a heartache  
Of the kind that will not pass by  
Even if you don't see the end  
Of what lies around the bend  
Don't stay that way  
It's all in a day believe me  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
How many times have I told you  
These are the tears I've shed  
Could it be that I need help  
Is it maybe I've come undone  
And one thing more  
You know it don't come easy  
Even the best of friends must part  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let love take a holiday  
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
Soon the storm will be over  
And the clouds will all pass by  
To be insane beyond belief  
Is sometimes the best relief  
And one thing sure  
Love never did come easy  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let love take a holiday  
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it  
Do not waste these hours away

Foo Fighters,Freaks By Live,"If the mother goes to sleep with you  
Will you run and tell geraldo  
If the mother bears your children without tears  
Without the usual costs of labor  
  
If the mother goes to bed with you

Or will take te first ear that comes into contact with your blade

With a cigarette hangin' out of your mouth and henry miller in your back

In the bowels of the cathedral

Or will you crash that beautiful silence with some talk about  
Finding yourself in you mother's arms  
  
Will you call her a freak  
Will you call them freaks  
Or will you call them gods

To ever find her so low  
You did not have to go, that far  
To show her you were holy  
  
Now you know they're gonna come for you  
And drag your silly name into the mud  
If the mother bears your children without tears  
And without the usual costs of labor  
  
Will you call her a freak  
Will you call them freaks  
Or will you call them gods

Designed it just for you

I'm giving you the only heart I have  
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough

It's not another game  
Or another simple move

Believe in me at all  
Are you telling me the truth?  
Is it just imagination  
Or the perfect dream  
That I'm here with you

There's nothing bad about our love  
I'm giving you the only heart I have  
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough

Take these boots they're going nowhere

You got my shoelaces undone  
Take my shirt, go on take it off me  
You can tear it up  
If you can tie me down

Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved

Take the colors of my imagination  
Take the scent hanging in the air  
Take this tangle of a conversation  
And turn it into your own prayer  
  
With my fingers as you want them  
With my nails under your hide  
With my teeth at your back  
And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies  
  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
And it looks like the sun  
But it feels like the rain  
  
Love's a bully pushing and shoving  
In the belly of a woman  
Heavy rhythm taking over  
To stick together  
A man and a woman  
Stick together  
Man and woman  
Stick together...  
  
And I feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
And it looks like the sun  
But it feels like the rain  
And there's heat in the sun  
To see us through the rain  
  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel...  
Do you feel...

Great Big Sea,Tickle Cove Pond,"In cuttin' and haulin' in frost and in snow  
We're up against troubles that few people know  
It's only by courage and patience and grit  
And eatin' plain food that we keep ourselves fit  
The hard and the easy we take as they come  
And when ponds freeze over we shorten our runs  
To hurry my haulin' with spring coming on  
I near lost me a mare out on Tickle Cove Pond  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
I knew that the ice grew weaker each day  
But still took the risk and kept haulin' away  
One evening in April, bound home with a load  
My mare showed some halting against the ice road  
She knew more than I did as matters turned out  
Been lucky for me had I joined her in doubt  
She turned round her head with tears in her eyes  
As if she was sayin', you're risking our lives  
  
All this I ignored with a whip-handle blow  
For man is a stupid dumb creature you know  
And the very next moment the pond gave a sigh  
And up to our necks went poor Kitty and I  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
And if I had taken wise Kitty's advice  
I ne'er would have made that shortcut on the ice  
Poor creature she's dead, poor creature she's gone  
I'll ne'er get my mare out of Tickle Cove Pond  
  
I raised an alarm you could hear for a mile  
And neighbors showed up in a very short while  
You can always rely on the Oldfords and Whites  
To render assistance in all your bad plights  
To help a kind neighbor is part of their lives  
The same can be said for their children and wives  
And with the rope fastened around the mare's breast  
William White for a shanty song made a request  
There was no time for thinkin', no time for delay  
Straight from his heart came this song right away  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond

He calls out in the night  
And it's so unfair  
At least it seems that way  
When you gave him his life  
  
And all this time he's been getting you down  
You ought to pick him up when there's no one around  
And convince him  
Just talk to him  
'cause he knows in his heart you won't be home soon  
He's an only child in an only room  
And he's dependent on you  
  
And it seems so strange  
That at the end of the day  
Making love can be so good  
But the Pain of birth  
What is it worth  
When it don't turn out the way it should

It's a moving world,  
but that's no reason  
To shoot some of those missiles  
Think of us as fatherless scum  
It won't be forgotten  
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?  
  
And the wrong words make you listen  
In this criminal world  
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable  
But our lives are valuable too  
  
We're learning to live with somebody's depression  
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression  
We'll get by I suppose  
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down  
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down  
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down  
And it won't be forgotten  
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

High School Musical,When There Was Me And You,"It's funny when you find yourself  
Looking from the outside  
I'm standing here but all I want  
Is to be over there  
Why did I let myself believe  
Miracles could happen  
Cause now I have to pretend  
That I don't really care  
  
I thought you were my fairytale  
A dream when I'm not sleeping  
A wish upon a star  
That's coming true  
But everybody else could tell  
That I confused my feelings with the truth  
When there was me and you  
  
I swore I knew the melody  
That I heard you singing  
And when you smiled  
You made me feel  
Like I could sing along  
But then you went and changed the words  
Now my heart is empty  
I'm only left with used-to-be's  
Once upon a song  
  
Now I know your not a fairytale  
And dreams were meant for sleeping  
And wishes on a star  
Just don't come true  
Cause now even I could tell  
That I confused my feelings with the truth  
Cause I liked the view and  
When there was me and you  
  
I can't believe that  
I could be so blind  
It's like you were floating  
While I was falling  
And I didn't mind  
  
Cause I liked the view  
Thought you felt it too  
When there was me and you

Deep Purple,Money Talks,"I was young and healthy  
Extremely wealthy  
I swung in the trees  
And did as I pleased  
I thought I was rich  
Oh yeah  
Such sweet seduction  
I could feel the suction  
Greasing my palm  
And doing no harm  
Just making some deals  
What a bitch  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
I had rising stock  
So I got more pockets  
I knew somewhere to stick it  
Where no-one would nick it  
I kinda went private  
And then, aha  
Such sweet seclusion  
No more intrusion  
Too much food on my plate  
But there's guards at the gate  
Such joy  
I could almost die of it  
  
Money talks to me  
Lays it on the line  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
Money goes to money  
Yes it always returns  
Finds its way back to the big house  
Where it lives all alone  
Wraith like silent partners  
Operators of the system  
Give words of quiet assurance  
To an otherwise healthy victim  
  
It's all coming back to me  
I would swing in the trees  
And I'd swim in the ocean  
I used to show some emotion  
  
I was not to blame  
I feel no shame  
The structure was shaking  
Was there for the taking  
I had the resources  
But then, oh no  
Someone outbid me  
I can't take it with me?  
Then I will devour it  
I can't go without it  
It's simply a question of  
Market forces  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
Money talks to me  
Laughs right in my face  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want

Kinks,Missing Persons,"Have you seen this face?  
Does it ring a bell?  
Does it strike a chord somewhere in your mind?  
And there's a big reward,  
If you help us solve this crime,  
And if you recognize this face, dial nine nine nine.  
  
Have you seen this face?  
Dig deep in your mind.  
Has anybody seen that little girl of mine?  
She was always a rover,  
But I'm afraid to say she's strayed  
Too far this time.  
  
Now I'm sitting at home, staring at the wall.  
Waiting for the missing person to call.  
Waiting for the message I'm dreading to hear.  
Waiting to confirm my darkest fears.  
She's a missing person, I wish I could see  
All of the places she might be.  
Maybe I stopped her from being free.  
Maybe there was something missing in me.  
  
Wherever she is, I hope she's doing fine,  
But I wish that she would phone or drop us a line.  
Till then I've got nothing to ease my mind,  
And I'm thinking about her all the time.

Miss never let a man help her off her throne  
So, by keeping her heart protected  
She'd never ever feel rejected

No more the need to be defensive  
Goodbye, old you  
When love is true  
  
Miss guarded heart  
Miss play it smart  
Miss if you want to use that line you better not start, no  
But she miscalculated  
She didn't want to end up jaded  
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love  
So, by changing her misconceptions  
She went in a new direction  
And found inside she felt a connection  
She fell in love.

When Miss Independence walked away  
No time for love that came her way  
She looked in the mirror and thought today  
What happened to miss no longer afraid?  
It took some time for her to see  
How beautiful love could truly be  
No more talk of why can't that be me  
I'm so glad I finally see

John Martyn,Spencer The Rover,"This tune was composed by Spencer the Rover  
As valiant a man as ever left home  
And he had been much reduced  
Which caused great confusion  
And that was the reason he started to roam  
In Yorkshire near Rotherham, he had been on the ramble  
Weary of traveling, he sat down to rest  
By the foot of yon' mountain  
Lays a clear flowing fountain  
With bread and cold water he himself did refresh  
With the night fast approaching, to the woods he resorted  
With woodbine and ivy his bed for to make  
But he dreamt about sighing  
Lamenting and crying  
Go home to your family and rambling forsake  
'Twas the fifth day of November, I've reason to remember  
When first he arrived home to his family and friends  
And they did stand so astounded  
Surprised and dumbfounded  
To see such a stranger once more in their sight  
And his children come around him with their prittle prattling stories  
With their prittle prattling stories to drive care away  
And he's as happy as those  
As have thousands of riches  
Contented he'll remain and not ramble away

As valiant a man as ever left home  
And he had been much reduced  
And caused great confusion

Hank Snow,Canadian Pacific,"I rode your ocean liner to Newfoundland,  
Where I made a living in an iron mine.  
When I got my fill I went to Nova Scotia,  
And I fished the salty waters for a time.  
  
Passing through Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick,  
I could see the rocks and cliffs of solid stone.  
Listening to the seagulls calling to each other  
Made me miss my darling and my distant home.  
  
Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,  
Through the valleys and the forests,  
To the sunshine of her smile,  
'Cross the plains and the rugged mountains,  
Keep this wandering boy from harm.  
Canadian Pacific, take me to my baby's arms.  
  
The Atlantic disappeared on the horizon,  
And Quebec lay waiting for me down the track.  
For a while I drove a truck to keep from star-ving.  
In Ontario I was a lumber-jack.  
  
Man-itoba and Saskatchewan then followed,  
Where the wheat fields and the old Red River flowed.  
In the quiet hours your whistling on the prairie,  
Touched my heart and set my memories aglow.  
  
I could feel the nearness of her warm, sweet kisses,  
When you rolled into Alberta westward bound.  
I worked on an oil rig to make some money,  
For a ticket to the sweetest girl around.  
  
Pushing on past Lake Louise in all it's splendor,  
Where the trees and Rockies touch the sky above,  
I got to British Columbia and heaven,  
On your track I made it back to my true love.  
  
Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,  
Through the valleys and the forests,  
To the sunshine of her smile.

When you're not sure if your dreaming  
I love, to fall asleep next to you  
  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me, I'll promise to fight  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do - I'll give my life, to you  
  
I get up, to see the sun set again  
Wishing that it never ends  
Watching lovers turn to friends  
I wanna feel like believing  
Knowing you, gave me a meaning  
I love, to fall asleep next to you  
  
I'm just a simple man...  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me, I'll promise to fight  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do - I'll give my life, to you  
  
In a world where everything remains in shadows  
The only ray of light is knowing that  
You'll be by my side  
  
I'm just a simple man...  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me, I'll promise to fight  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do - I'll give my life, to you

Evanescence,Bleed,"How can I pretend that I don't see,  
What you hide so carelesslly,  
I saw her bleed,  
And you heard me breathe,  
And I froze inside myself,  
And turned away,  
I must be dreaming  
  
We all live, we all die,  
That does not begin to justify you  
  
It's not what it seems,  
Not what you think,  
No, I must be dreaming,  
It's only in my mind,  
Not real life,  
No, I must be dreaming  
  
Help you know I've got to tell someone,  
Tell them what I know you've done,  
I fear you, but spoken fears can come true  
  
We all live, we all die,  
That does not begin to justify you  
  
It's not what it seems,  
Not what you think,  
No I must be dreaming,  
It's only in my mind,  
Not real life,  
No I must be dreaming

Just in my mind,  
Not real life,

Rammstein,Kuess Mich,"Sie haelt immer still  
Weil sie gefingert werden will  
Blaeht sich auf I'm duerren gras  
Das feuchte aeugelein wird nass  
  
Gefangen in der finsternis  
Sieht sie nie das licht der sonne  
Vor geilheit zuckend fleht sie dann  
Die zunge in dem manne an  
  
Kuess mich  
  
Sie beisst sich in jeder zunge fest  
Weil sie sich gerne lecken laesst  
Doch weil es etwas bitter schmeckt  
Wird sie selten nur gekuesst  
  
Gefangen in ...  
  
Kuess mich  
  
Die zunge kriecht jetzt aus dem mund  
Und schlaegt ihr wild und in extase  
Mehrmals heftig ins gesicht  
Sie blutet schrecklich aus der nase  
  
Gefangen in ...  
  
Kuess mich  
Auf meine feuchten lippen  
Kuess mich  
Auch wenn es bitter schmeckt  
Kuess mich

Great Big Sea,Old Brown's Daughter,"There is an ancient party at the other end of town  
And he keeps a little grocery store, the ancients name is Brown  
And he has a lovely daughter, such a treat I never saw  
Oh I only hope someday to be the old man's son-in-law.  
  
Well, Old Brown he sells from off his shelf most anything you please  
He's got juice tarts for the little boys, lollipops and cheese  
And his daughter minds the store, and it's a treat just to see her serve  
I'd like to run away with her but I don't have the nerve

Old Brown's daughter is a fair as any pearl  
I wish I were a Lord Mayor, a Marquis or and Earl  
And blow me if I wouldn't marry old Brown's girl.  
Blow me if I wouldn't marry old Brown's girl.  
  
Well, poor old Brown now has trouble with the gout,  
He grumbles in his little parlor when he can't get out  
Oh and when I make a purchase, lord, and she hands me the change  
That girl she makes pulverized, I feel so very strange

But Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly when I say a tender word  
Ah but old brown says that she must wed a Marquis or a Lord,  
And I don't suppose it's ever one of those things I will be  
But by jingo next election I will run for Trinity

I'm a gangster, I'm a straight up G  
The gangster life is the life for me  
Shooting people by day, selling drugs by night  
Being a gangster is hella tight.  
I walk around town with a stark erection, then gave your mom a yeast infection  
I saw the police man and I punched him in the eye  
To serve and protect, what A lie!  
I also don't like white people, you shouldn't too  
And don't get me started about the jews

Coz all the teachers tried to player hate on me.(oh)  
My rhymes are cool, just like doing cocaine  
My rhymes are hot, like a burning flame  
Sisqo is my homie, he's a ganster too  
Me and Sisqo are the leaders of the gangster crew  
I like to be in jail and he likes to sing and dance(yay)

Don't step forwards! Step back! Backwards, don't step to me! Do not step to

Being in jail sucks 'cause you always have to masturbate  
Except when a Jewish person goes to jail all my homies cheer  
They will make mince meat out of his rear  
Ben Peddy helped me make the gangster beat to this song  
I shot him in the face coz he looked at me wrong  
  
I'm a gangster  
I drop bombs like Hiroshima  
I'm a gangster  
Bitch suck on my wiener!  
I'm a gangster  
I drive a cool car  
I'm a gangster  
I smoke weed in a cigar  
  
Yo my gangster flow  
Yo, yo yo yo  
  
Nobody thought I'd blow up like a firestone tire-  
Oh there's no beat left

U2,Stories For Boys,"There's a place I go  
And I am far away  
There's a TV show  
And I can grow  
  
Sometimes the hero takes me  
Sometimes I don't let go  
Hello hello  
  
There's a picture book  
With colored photographs  
There's a comic strip  
That makes me laugh  
  
Sometimes the lady takes me  
Sometimes I don't let go  
Hello hello

Rod Stewart,Angel,"Angel came down from heaven yesterday  
Stayed with me long enough to rescue me  
And she told me a story yesterday  
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea  
Then she spread her wings high over me  
She said she's goin' now, come back tomorrow  
  
And I said, Fly on my sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side  
  
Fly away, high away, fly away  
  
Sure enough this morning came unto me  
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise  
And my angel she said unto me  
Today's the day for you to rise  
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise  
Then she took me high over yonder  
  
And I said, Fly on my sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Forever I will be by your side  
  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Forever I will be by your side

Marillion,100 Nights,"A hundred nights of fun and games  
A thousand empty glasses  
I feel it change  
And stay the same  
As each day passes  
  
They invite me to their gatherings  
In the finer parts of town  
They seem attracted to my indifference  
The irony just knocks me out  
  
And I love them as if I love them  
And they reciprocate with ""help""  
But I look up at these mirrors sometimes  
And I can't see myself  
  
They say that some are born to burn  
And some are born to give  
They say that people live and learn  
Some people only live and live  
  
You don't know that I come here  
But if you did, you would know why  
So we close our eyes  
  
You didn't notice me  
As I passed you on the stairs  
How could you ever guess  
Looking at my face  
How closely I share your taste  
How well I know your place  
Even the clothes you wear  
I've seen them when you're not there  
  
You say that you can win win win  
If you know how to play the game  
But while you're out there playing you see  
There's something you should know  
She spends your money  
She spends your money on me

Kelly Clarkson,Long Shot,"I felt it, the wire touched my neck  
And then someone pulled it tighter  
I never saw it coming, I started to black out  
And then someone said good morning  
I took it as a warning  
I should have seen it coming  
So now I'll take a chance on  
  
This thing we may have started  
Intentional or not, I don't think we saw it coming  
It's all adding up to something  
That asks for some involvement  
That ask for our commitment  
I think I see it coming  
If we step out of that limb  
  
My heart beat beats me senselessly  
Why's everything got to be so intense with me  
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability  
In all probability  
  
It's a long shot, but I say why not  
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance  
'Cause you're the best I got  
So take a long shot  
  
I realize that there is all this starting  
Things we're both scared about  
That we'll never see them coming  
Throw caution to the wind  
And we'll see which way it's blowing  
And to this pulling on  
We'll never see it coming  
Until it's much to close to stop  
  
My heart beat beats me senselessly  
Why's everything got to be so intense with me  
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability  
In all probability  
  
It's a long shot, but I say why not  
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance  
'Cause you're the best I got  
So take a long shot  
  
Oh I waited for fact to come of fiction  
And you fit my description  
I never saw you coming  
But we'll make it  
  
It's a long shot, but I say why not  
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance, no chance

A time for gifts and giving  
And as the year draws to it's close  
I think about my living  
  
The Christmas time when I was young,  
The magic and the wonder,  
But colors dull and candles dim,  
And dark my standing under  
  
O little Zachary, shining light  
You've set my soul to dreaming  
You've given back my joy in life  
And filled me with new meaning  
  
A Savior King was born that day,  
A baby just like you,  
And as the Magi came with gifts,  
I come with my gift too  
That peace on Earth fills up your time,  
That brotherhood surrounds you.  
  
That you may know the warmth of love,  
And wrap it all around you  
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told  
From days when I was young  
  
Merry Christmas, little Zachary  
Merry Christmas, everyone  
Merry Christmas, little Zachary  
Merry Christmas, everyone

Man dreams one day to fly  
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies  
He lives on a star that's dying in the night  
And follows in the trail  
The scatter of light  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it on

Slow down my beating heart  
Slowly, slowly love

You gotta put your faith in a loud guitar

You can work real hard or just fantasize

Everyone will seek its' home

And the light will touch the tide

Like a penny in a spin  
Always looking for the way  
To get out, to get in

On the high roads of Peru

And another dance will start  
And I'll finally get the point  
Like an arrow to my heart

Who brought this mystery?  
Deep in another world  
Someone is listening

And we keep asking why  
Look back there's the key  
Deep in another life  
  
On this ship in which we sail  
Everything is possible  
Keep on turning like a star  
Till you get to where you are  
  
If I promise not to laugh  
Will you promise not to cry?  
Will you promise not to let this life  
Slip by?

As they spread into a town  
I was lookin' for another sundown

Lookin' through the eyes of danger  
Lookin' at the all-night dancer  
Never takin' all the chances  
  
As I walked into the main street  
Saw a crowd across the square  
And I heard a guitar playin'  
And I saw you standing there  
  
Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger  
Lookin' through the eyes of danger  
Lookin' at the all-night dancer

Somewhere far off in the night

But I know the answers lie  
Far from this world  
  
Close every door  
Close every door to me

Lil Wayne,Duffle Bag Boy,"[hook:]  
If I don't nothin' I'm a ball  
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall  
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy  
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy get money  
And I ain't ever ran from a nigga and I  
Damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin'  
Look honey I ain't never ran from a nigga and I  
Damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' get money  
  
The beat so hot the flow is so ice cold  
Walkin' to the Gucci store honey I'm home  
I am on my shit I need a pamper on me  
Toilet paper on the side for example homie  
I, get, money  
I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this and  
While you wishing on that fallin' star I'm in a foreign car  
Smoking out with the doors ajar  
Suede sun roof hangin' out the big top  
We leave the dealership head to the rim shop  
You niggas barely dressin' I got thousands piling  
That's that salad dressin' I'm on my thousand island  
Wildin' stylin' I be I get so much money its my i.d  
Don't try me and if I dont do nuthin' I'm a fuckin' ball  
And I ain't bout to start runnin' naw nigga naw  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't nothin' to a boss we ballin' when you see us  
We hear them haters callin' they too far off to see us  
Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game  
Class is now in session now try to stay focus mane  
Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough  
Would've could've should've wont do with us true enough  
Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin' new to us  
Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us  
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up  
Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'm a stack up  
Flows like a river the current is so rapid  
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens  
Next time you're yappin' make sure it be about that big money talk  
Let that lil' money walk call me what you want but don't call me for front  
Southside I got what you want come holla at me

Tears For Fears,Closest Thing To Heaven,"28 days of rain  
Flash floods in February  
Back in our boats again  
Bath water and the baby  
What am I gonna do?  
There's been a lot of drinking  
Looking at ghosts of you  
While all the world is sinking  
  
10.000 miles into the atmosphere  
My body shakes  
Is there a welcome here?  
  
Closest thing to heaven  
How do you do it?  
Closest thing to heaven, heaven  
  
Throw your arms round the world  
Make love your destination  
Here we go boys and girls  
Act like a generation  
Give me that ball and chain  
By now it must be hurting  
Dragging your feet again  
Just like a beast of burden  
When one and one and one make two  
I know I'm high because I've captured you,  
yeah  
  
Closest thing to heaven  
Yeah, it's you  
Closest thing to heaven, heaven  
  
Look the world right in the eye  
Eat the countries that are making billions  
Sweet as homemade apple pie  
Saved by crumbs for all the starving millions, yeah  
  
Closest thing to heaven  
Closest thing to heaven  
How do you do it?  
Closest thing to heaven  
Hey

Rod Stewart,Mandolin Wind,"When the rain came I thought you'd leave  
'Cause I knew how much you loved the sun  
But you chose to stay, stay and keep me warm  
through the darkest nights I've ever known  
If the mandolin wind couldn't change a thing  
then I know I love ya  
  
Oh the snow fell without a break  
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know  
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years  
I couldn't believe you kept a smile  
Now I can rest assured knowing that we've seen the worst  
And I know I love ya  
  
Oh I never was good with romantic words  
So the next few lines come really hard  
Don't have much but what I've got is yours  
Except of course my steel guitar  
Ha, 'cause I know you don't play  
But I'll teach you one day  
Because I love ya  
  
I recall the night we knelt and prayed  
Noticing your face was thin and pale  
I found it hard to hide my tears  
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down  
No mandolin wind couldn't change a thing  
Couldn't change a thing no, no  
  
The coldest winter in almost fourteen years  
Could never, never change your mind  
  
And I love ya  
Yes indeed and I love ya  
And I love ya  
Lord I love ya

Andy Williams,Love Story,"Where do I begin  
To tell the story  
Of how great a love can be  
The sweet love story  
That is older than the sea  
The simple truth about the love she brings to me  
Where do I start  
  
With her first hello  
She gave new meaning  
To this empty world of mine  
There'll never be  
Another love, another time  
She came into my life  
And made the living fine  
She fills my heart  
  
She fills my heart  
With very special things  
With angel songs  
With wild imaginings  
She fills my soul  
With so much love  
That anywhere I go  
I'm never lonely  
With her along who could be lonely  
I reach for her hand  
It's always there  
  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there

And your tears fell dying on the floor  
  
And I'm brought down,  
And I don't think I can get up again  
Brought down,  
My heart is hurt again  
  
You were the fine lady in the early mornings  
That always painted her toes  
And lookin' towards the east  
You'd say hello to the early dawn before they rose  
And you were the love lady  
That always hung up her finely pressed clothes  
And sayin' so long to the western sundown,  
You taught me how it grows

And I don't think I can get up again

Okay, maybe I'm trying too hard to hang on  
But whenever I hold you, you never look into my eyes, surprised  
I guess I was fooling myself all along  
Love lies 'cause it doesn't last forever  
Love lies, it makes you feel so clever  
You give and it just takes  
And leaves your heart to ache, love lies  
Whenever I kiss you, you never want to lose control, so cold  
It's taken so long to find out  
But now I see that we can't even talk now  
How your love always turned me on  
They're gone, this isn't how I thought love is gonna be  
Love lies 'cause it doesn't last forever  
Love lies though it makes you feel so clever  
You can give and it just takes  
And leaves your heart to ache, love lies  
Love lies, love lies  
Love lies, love lies

Only just to believe  
So believe

Can't put my mind at ease with the words I say  
Trying to get myself to get out of my way  
Birds in the trees just make me depressed  
Seeing sunny skies, feeling emptiness  
  
Layers of lies just seem to fold  
This kind of life is all I know

Murder wears a friendly smile  
Like the perfect end in a plastic vial

Fly away, fly away  
  
Layers of lies just seem to fold  
This kind of life is all I know

I'd love to believe  
I can believe in something  
I will believe

Lou Reed,Set The Twilight Reeling,"Take me for what I am a star newly emerging  
Long simmering explodes inside the self is reeling  
In the pocket of the heart, in the rushing of the blood  
In the muscle of my sex, in the mindful mindless love  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
At 5 am the moon and the sun sit set before my window  
Light glances off the blue glass we set right before the window  
And you who accept in your soul and your head  
What was misunderstood what was thought of with dread  
A new self is born the other self dead  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
A soul singer stands on the stage the spotlight shows him sweating  
He sinks to one knee Seems to cry the horn are unrelenting  
But as the drums beats he finds himself growing hard  
In the microphone's face he sees her face growing large  
And the swelling crescendo no longer retards  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
As the twilight sunburst gleams  
As the chromium moon it sets  
As I lose all my regrets and set the twilight reeling  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling

Rolling Stones,Dancing With Mr. D,"Down in the graveyard where we have our tryst  
The air smells sweet, the air smells sick  
He never smiles, his mouth merely twists  
The breath in my lungs feels clinging and thick  
But I know his name, he's called Mr. D.  
And one of these days he's gonna set you free  
Human skulls is hangin' right 'round his neck  
The palms of my hands is clammy and wet  
  
Lord, I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free  
Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free  
Dancin', Lord, keep your hand off me  
Dancin' with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D.  
  
Will it be poison put in my glass  
Will it be slow or will it be fast?  
The bite of a snake, the sting of a spider  
A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night  
Hiding in a corner in New York City  
Lookin' down a forty-four in West Virginia  
  
I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free  
Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free  
Dancin', Lord, keep your hand off me  
Dancin' with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D.  
  
One night I was dancin' with a lady in black  
Wearin' black silk gloves and a black silk hat  
She looked at me longin' with black velvet eyes  
She gazed at me strange all cunning and wise  
Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones  
The eyes in her skull was burning like coals  
Lord, have mercy, fire and brimstone  
I was dancin' with Mrs. D.  
  
Lord, I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free  
I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free

Stand for the truth you stand alone

Holding a gun to his head  
He said man, oh man  
What am I gonna do  
I can't change the past but I can change the future  
If I pull this trigger right now, right here  
Everything will be over  
Not a day goes by I don't see them in my dreams  
Not a day goes by I don't hear them screaming in my ears  
Begging for mercy, pleading innocent  
Since my heart is made up to be as cold  
As the barrel of this gun I hold  
I would pull the trigger anyway  
  
Chorus  
I was a soldier, following instructions from a man  
We have known as the general  
So many medals, so many praises  
Nothing can take away the guilt  
That I feel inside me  
Government covered up every crime we committed  
Against human kind  
Not a day goes by, I don't see them in my dreams  
Not a day goes by, I don't hear them crying in my ears

Forget your name

Walk away and don't look back  
But if you must then cast a stone  
The light is on but there's nothing and no one home (I think)

Taiking you

Money got a little dust on it

Fell in love with that white girl

Double back duwop for lunch, big guns that shoot outside front

Right now my mom there in the kitchen, basting the Christmas bird  
You'll have to take my word, you can't find that at the automat  
An old fashioned fireplace, give me an old fashioned fireplace  
My heart remembers smoldering embers, warming your glow  
I'd trade that whole Manhattan skyline, the shimmering steel and chrome  
For one old fashioned Christmas back home

We're crying, crying for this generation  
We're praying for Your Name to be known in all of the earth  
We're watching, watching on the walls to see You  
We're looking, looking for a time of breakthrough  
We're praying for Your Word to bear fruit in all of the earth

Somebody get these niggas some wheelchairs or somethin'  
Goin' to war is still a scary issue  
But in my hood they train to kill wit every pistol  
Like a military issue  
Guess you a star if you sell a million every disc two  
Catch a gun case an' bounce, still they'll barely frisk you  
'cause, I proved I move the retail  
Make the smoothest grooves wit female  
And I remove the rules on V12's  
You never ain't never seen it move this smooth on Sprewell's  
I'm a hustler, he's just a middle man to me  
The way I pass the rock, could make Jason Kidd a fan of me  
Just cop one joint, I'm a one point somethin'  
Still I had you at gunpoint, with one joint dumpin'  
So watch what you say to them, crackers  
I'll put a couple g's on yer head, like you play for the packers  
I'm rap's Labron James, I quickly see baskets  
These scrubs wouldn't make it to the Mickey-D's classics  
You got some sticky weed, pass it  
If not put it out, I'm pushin' it before they put it out  
Wit the dash, wooded out, Shaq O'Neal, footed out  
Blastin' a do-did-it, first before they put it out, clue  
Maybe wouldn't be a million kids wit they faces on containers  
If cops pursue the same way they chase us entertainers  
In the hood, a few big faces and a chain-a  
Get metal in ya mouth, like braces and retainers  
Even the young bucks be scheming on somebody change  
Tryin' a sell somebody 'cain, before they even potty trained  
You can smooth talk your way into a hottie brain  
Have her suckin' long enough to leave a nigga body drained  
I wasn't taught, I learned from watchin' stupid people  
That'll run up shootin' in front of a group of people  
I lay in a cut, the same way the troopers peep you  
Ride up on yer Coupe creep you  
Why you let a groupie deep you?  
'cause even if you reppin' like a man of steel  
You gon' still need a weapon when you land a deal  
One for watch you slippin' like you steppin' on banana peels  
Think a nigga ain't gon' pull a weapon 'cause you scanned a mil'?  
I crept in and got handed meals  
Now the white and black rides look like salt, pepper on a bannon grill  
Think I wouldn't hold a Pepsi in my hand for mil's?  
You must be fuckin' stupid, nigga

The tears and sorrow I have caused her  
How I wish I could re-pay  
But tell her I'll be waiting for her  
We'll meet in heaven some glad day.  
  
How she cried when I left her  
I know it filled her heart with pain  
She said, son, please don't leave me  
For we may never meet again.

Years have passed since that parting  
But I know she waits and prays  
Soon I'll cross that dark river  
Please let her know that I was saved.

John McDermott,The Dutchman,"The Dutchman's not the kind of man  
To keep his thumb jammed in the dam  
That holds his dreams in  
But that's a secret only Margaret knows  
  
When Amsterdam is golden in the morning  
Margaret brings him breakfast  
She believes him  
He thinks the tulips bloom  
beneath the snows  
He's mad as he can be  
But Margaret only sees that sometimes  
Sometimes she sees her unborn children  
In his eyes  
  
(Chorus)  
Let us go to the banks of the ocean  
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee  
Long ago I used to be a young man  
And dear Margaret remembers for me.  
  
The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes  
His cap and his coat are patched with love  
That Margaret sewed in  
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam  
  
He watches tug boats down canals  
And calls out to them  
When he thinks he knows the captain  
Til Margaret comes to take him home again  
Through unforgiving streets  
A tripping though she holds his arm.  
Sometimes he thinks that he's alone  
And calls her name  
  
(Chorus)  
The windmills swirl. The winter air  
She winds his muffler tighter  
They sit in the kitchen  
And the tea with wiskey keep away the dew  
He sees her for a moment, calls her name  
She makes his bed up  
Humming some old love song.  
She learned it when the tune was vey new  
He hums a line or two, they hum together in the night  
The Dutchman falls asleep  
And Margaret blows the candle out.

You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy

But I could see it's not the same

Give it all for that to change

To lose her  
Don't let her go

Standing out in the rain  
Need to know if it's over  
Cause I would leave you alone  
Flooded with all this pain  
Knowing that I'll never hold her  
Like I did before the storm  
  
Yeah  
Before the storm  
  
With every strike of lightening  
Comes a memory that lasts  
And not a word is left unspoken  
As a thunder starts to crash  
Maybe I should give up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trying to keep  
The light from going out  
And the clouds were ripping out my broken heart  
They always say  
A heart is not a home  
Without the one who gets you through the storm

Carpenters,The Rainbow Connection,"Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side?  
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide.  
So we've been told and some choose to believe it.  
I know they're wrong wait and see.  
  
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.  
The lovers, the dreamers and me.  
Who said that wishes would be heard and answered when wished on the
morningstar?  
  
Someone thought of that and someone believed it.  
Look what it's done so far.  
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing and what do we think we might see?  
  
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.  
The lovers, the dreamers and me.  
All of us under its spell.  
We know that it's probably magic.  
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?  
I've heard them calling my name.  
  
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors.  
The voice might be one and the same.  
  
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.  
It's something that I'm supposed to be.  
  
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers and
me.  
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers and

Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control

Has fallen apart right in front of you

Pogues,A Pair Of Brown Eyes,"One summer evening drunk to hell  
I sat there nearly lifeless  
An old man in the corner sang  
Where the water lilies grow  
And on the jukebox johnny sang  
About a thing called love  
And it's how are you kid and what's your name  
And how would you bloody know?  
In blood and death neath a screaming sky  
I lay down on the ground  
And the arms and legs of other men  
Were scattered all around  
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed  
Then prayed and bled some more  
And the only thing that I could see  
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me  
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three  
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me  
  
And a rovin a rovin a rovin I'll go  
For a pair of brown eyes  
  
I looked at him he looked at me  
All I could do was hate him  
While ray and philomena sang  
Of my elusive dream  
I saw the streams, the rolling hills  
Where his brown eyes were waiting  
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes  
That waited once for me  
So drunk to hell I left the place  
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking  
A hungry sound came across the breeze  
So I gave the walls a talking  
And I heard the sounds of long ago  
From the old canal  
And the birds were whistling in the trees  
Where the wind was gently laughing  
  
And a rovin a rovin a rovin I'll go  
For a pair of brown eyes

Neil Young,Be With You,"Crossin' the river in a big old boat,  
With a dollar bill in my hand.  
Gonna go fishin' in the afternoon,  
Got a simple plan.  
Oh yeah, baby.  
  
I got to hold on,  
I got to be strong,  
I got to live long,  
And be with you.  
  
Lonely nights and lonely days,  
When I'm not with you.  
Learned to trust and I learned to give,  
Found a love that's true.  
Oh yeah, baby.  
  
I got to hold on,  
I got to be strong,  
I got to live long,  
And be with you.  
  
Girl it shouldn't be too hard,  
To live with you.  
It's really not complicated,  
Until I get the blues.  
  
Come on over and sit right down,  
Let me take your hand,  
I got a love gonna fill you up,  
Take you to the promised land.  
Oh yeah, baby, oh yeah.

When I'm not with you babe.  
Learned to trust and I learned to give,  
Found a love that's true, babe.  
Oh yeah, baby.  
  
I got to hold on now,  
Got to be strong now,  
To be with you.  
Be with you baby,

XTC,Desert Island,"Cast away on a desert island  
Me and poor Crusoe are sharing the same fate  
Cast away on a desert island  
With Great Britain written on its name plate  
With my umbrella I go walking  
Through all the sands on a building site  
Across the shopping malls and motorways  
Birds from Heathrow fill the  
Night with people flying to escape  
Friday comforts me and says it's pay day  
Cast away on a desert island...  
The game and coconuts is plentiful  
You pick 'em right off of a supermarket shelf  
And all the man-eaters are parked away  
Down in garages  
While their selfish owners drinking to escape  
Lord of flies with cocktails in his conch shell  
Don't rescue me, no  
This is my home sweet home dear  
Don't rescue me, no  
I am far from alone here  
Cast away on a desert island  
Me and one nation are sharing the same fate

Dallas lives in Winston Salem we got married in West Virginia  
Then we moved to Texas on a fifty acre farm  
I robbed a bank and shot a man ended up in Birmingham  
But I guess I tipped my hand and wound up in the pen  
Say goodbye to Houston for me...

She's gonna make her living reaching for a star

Omd,If You're Still In Love With Me,"First you say you're in love with me and that it lasts eternally.  
Then I find that you change your mind, but one and one will not make three.  
Well, I'm glad to say the distance is one thing I never mind.  
But every thought of leaving is the last thing on my mind.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.  
  
Everything that I've promised you,  
I tried and tried to make it all come true.  
But if I break your heart again, well this time it'll never mend.  
When I beg for freedom, you only chain me down.  
With everyday that passes now, the answer can't be found.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.  
  
All across the nation.  
People in frustration.  
There's those who need someone to stay.  
And those who've got to run away.

Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through

And I got a whole lot more to say  
Roy just crossed the floor and picked up his car keys

And that's why God made Mexico  
A place where we can lay low  
Where the Cuervo goes down nice and slow  
And the warm winds blow  
That's why God made Mexico  
  
And Betty fixed Joe dinner every night half past six  
'Cause that's when he'd roll through that door  
Sixteen years and not a thank you from his lips  
She don't fix him dinner no more

Life is sweet in a border town  
You learn to let your hair down  
And you don't make trouble  
You learn to dance the fandango  
  
You change your name and you change your face  
Get used to beans and chile paste  
And learn to live and love life in the slow lane  
  
And that's why God made Mexico  
A place where we can lay low  
Maybe Monterey or Acapulco  
Anywhere the warm winds blow  
Don't you know  
That's why God made Mexico  
That's why God made Mexico

Because it's hard to get the way you move out of my dreams

Arrogant Worms,Shipwreck Balladeer,"I have been since seventeen a shipwreck balladeer  
Tragedy and misery are what makes my career  
Watery graves are my stock and trade, but it's getting harder  
For all the boats that now do float are returning safely to the harbour  
There hasn't been a shipwreck scene since 1965  
And I find I cry each time a crew returns alive  
I only cheer when gales appear and threaten fresh disaster  
They pass by, the boat survives, only my career's in tatters  
They're building ships too good today, and I'm the one who suffers  
They don't get rent from aft to stern and their halls never rupture  
Not dashed on rocks and never tossed to heaven on a wave  
You may think it well and good but my livelihood sails away  
There once were found, twenty in town, who wrote about shipwrecks  
When boats sank lots, just like rocks, 'twas good as it gets  
But the golden ages passed away and I'm barely survivin'  
The balladeers are dead I fear and workin' in advertisin'  
They're building ships too good today and it's hurtin' me  
Why can't even one poor soul fall into the dark sea  
And be ripped apart by hungry sharks in a bloody spree  
You may think it well and good, but my livelihood sails away  
Oh the only tragedy left to sing about is me  
That government bastard's been sent to take my job from me  
That inspector's making sure the ships are seaworthy  
He can try, no way will I ever give up hope  
When he went by, I did pry a big hole in his boat  
They're building ships too good today, so I helped one along  
How sweet it is to once again hear the tortured song  
Of a man afloat a sinking boat, who knows he will die today  
You might think it bad not good, but my livelihood's here to stay  
It's here to staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

Another loneliness overload  
Ah, but I'd wait a hundred years  
For a glimpse of her smile  
And the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin' soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm  
Anything I could hope to be  
With the touch of her hand  
  
Half-kept promises  
And dreamer's hopes  
Love by phone  
And ""miss you"" notes  
And I meant to give so much more  
Well, so much for plans  
  
But if she thinks that I've let her down  
Chasin' fool's gold from town to town  
You would never know by the love in her eyes

his raincoat and a face showing a yet unknown way out of it. Steamy hot summer

To introduce myself

In which pocket I got my matches

Who gives you all of her love

Let is stray  
'Cause one thing for certain  
You will surely be hurting  
If you throw it all away  
If you throw it all away

And trials turn to gold  
He shared with me, His victory  
He won in days of old  
  
Oh Lord, I don't deserve  
The riches of your word  
But You've changed my filthy rags  
To linen white as snow  
  
The view from here is nothing near  
To what it is for You  
I tried to see Your plan for me  
But I only acted like I knew  
  
Oh Lord forgive the times  
I tried to read your mind  
Cause you said if I'd be still  
Then I would hear your voice  
  
My Lord, my King, my urge to sing  
And praise the things above  
No words can say the glorious way  
You changed me with your love  
  
He's brought me low, so I could know  
The way to reach the heights  
To forsake my dreams, my self esteem  
And give up all my rights  
  
With each one that I lay down  
A jewel's placed in my crown  
Cause His love, the things above  
Is all we'll ever need  
  
He's brought me here, where things are clear  
And trials turn to gold

The Beatles,I Am The Walrus,"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.  
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly.

Lucky Dube,Shembe Is The Way,"It wasn't the valley of death, I was walking in  
It was the valley of confusion for many years  
Different religions, different beliefs  
Undermining my culture  
Looking down upon my tradition  
Making fun of my language  
Telling my children, they have no God  
Finally I can tell them about,  
Shembe is the way  
Chorus  
Oh SHEMBE thank you for showing us the way.  
Shembe nobunazaretha.  
Oh SHEMBE thank you for healing my people.  
Shembe nobunazaretha.  
Shemebe is the way.  
I hear them shoulting Amen,  
At the top of the mountain  
I hear them shouting Uyingcwele  
At the top of the mountain.  
No one will undermine my religion  
No one will undermine my culture anymore,  
Cause God sent him from above, to be with the people.  
Bring them back to what is their own  
Take them back to the ways Of our forefathers.  
Finally I can tell generations and generations  
That Shembe is the way  
Chorus  
Oh Shemebe THANK YOU FOR SHOWING US THE WAY.  
Shembe Nobunazaretha.

Lucky Dube,Slave,"Ministers of religion  
Have visited me many times  
To talk about it  
They say to me  
I gotta leave it I gotta leave it  
It's a bad habit  
For a man  
But when I try to leave it  
My friends keep telling me  
I'm a fool amongst fools

Now I'm a slave, a slave  
I'm a slave  
I'm a liquor slave  
I'm a slave, a slave, slave

Just a liquor slave  
I have lost my dignity  
I had before trying  
To please everybody  
Some say to me  
Yo yo  
I look better when I'm drunk  
Some say no no no  
I look bad you know  
Sometimes I cry  
I cry but my crying  
Never helps me none

''cause now I am a slave, a slave  
I'm a slave  
I'm just a liquor slave  
I am a slave, a prisoner  
I'm a slave  
Just a liquor slave  
Every night when I'm  
Coming back home  
My wife gets worried  
''cause she knows  
She's got double trouble  
Coming home  
Sometimes I cry  
I cry lord I cry  
But my crying  
Never helps me

Reo Speedwagon,Stillness Of The Night,"Midnight on the hill I heard the thunder fill  
The stillness of the night  
It hit me like a slap, you're never comin' back  
From the stillness of the night  
It was never black or white, neither wrong or right  
Like the shadow of a full moon's light  
I knew we'd lost the track, when I heard the lightning crack  
The stillness of the night  
  
[Chorus]  
In the stillness of the night  
That's when we'll make it right  
We can stop the thunder till the light  
In the stillness of the night  
  
I know you think you hear, those voices in your ear  
In the stillness of the night  
But I've tried to make it clear there's nothing left to fear  
Just the stillness of the night  
And if you listen hard you might find the reason for your fright  
Just the wind is high tonight  
And the danger we must face is the anger of this race  
In the stillness of the night

Uncle Kracker,(I'm Gonna) Split This Room In Half,"I know a guy who took too many pills  
Now he's got a mansion that sits on a hill  
14 million served that's correct  
17 cars, 3 cribs, and 2 jets  
I came to test to blood, sweat, tears  
Persevered for ten long years  
10 years, I was there for 8  
And I ain't seen a meaner mother puttin' food on our plate  
I've learned to hate, and that's a damn shame  
Because I'm gettin' pretty good at this bitch ass game  
See, fame ain't the problem, it's broke?  
Pissin' on my dog cause they're down on their luck  
Now you're stuck like a pig in the poke  
You know you're makin' him mad, and you're goin' to get choked  
Don't you know every dog has a limit  
Yo, I'm about to kick somebody's ass in a minute  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm Gonna Split This Room In Half  
Why'd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
I'm Gonna Split This Room In Half  
(I said) Why'd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
I'm Gonna Split This Room In Half  
Why'd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
I'm Gonna Split This Room In Half  
(I said) Why'd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
  
Sometimes success leads to stress  
Legal roles and dumb (hoes) and death threats  
Nat work for network and that works  
And people jerk for perks that ain't theirs  
And that hurts, you work your whole life  
And that still ain't enough  
Cause a bunch of punks wanna poach your stuff  
That's not your stuff  
So don't touch that  
And don't make me break with this baseball bat, cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're not playing nice  
My dog likes to share  
You're going to get smacked for not playing fair  
It's in the air you can feel the tension  
We don't take kind to senseless dissension  
You bark like a dog. You fight like a dog  
You live by your dog. You die by your dog  
Now there's a calm before the storm  
And I'd hate to be you when it starts to get warm  
Clouds are forming. Crowds are swarming  
You've had for-warning. Now pray for mourning, cause

By what gravity brings to the ground?  
Did you feel you were tricked  
By the future you picked?  
Well, come on down

When you're high in the sky  
So, come on down

And the land will be looked after

By changing the script and the scene?  
Despite all you made of it

Well, you can come as my guest  
So come on down

We learned to live off the good land  
We learned to climb up a tree  
Then we got up on two legs  
But we wanted to fly  
When we messed up our homeland  
We set sail for the sky

Kinks,Nobody Gives,"I can't understand why everybody's quarreling,  
Nobody gives in case they lose face,  
And everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent,  
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more.  
It's the same throughout all history,  
Nobody gives unless they receive,  
And nobody trusts or is willing to believe  
And nobody gives or is willing to concede.  
Back in nineteen hundred and twenty-five  
There were thousands of people struggling to survive.  
There was hunger, unemployment and poverty,  
Then in 1926 they decided to be free  
So they all went on strike and  
The workers told the unions, who blamed it on the government,  
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants,  
Everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent,  
But the fact of it is nobody gives any more.  
Back in nineteen hundred and thirty-nine  
There were scores of German military waiting in a line,  
And the Fatherland wanted what the world wouldn't give,  
And then Hitler decided he could take what was his,  
So they all went to war and said  
Kill all the left-wing intellectuals,  
Annihilate the Jews and wipe out their race,  
Eliminate the weak because they're ineffectual,  
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more.  
I'm only sitting here watching it all go on  
And listening to both sides.  
Yeah, why can't we talk it out,  
Why can't we sort it out,  
We'll work it out if we try.  
Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,  
Why not negotiate and try to be civilised?  
I'll tell you why, because nobody gives a damn.  
Nobody listens and no one will understand.  
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,  
And listening to both sides.  
Why can't we work it out?  
Why can't we sort it out?  
We'll work it out if we try.  
Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,  
Why not negotiate and try to be civilized?  
I'll tell you why, because nobody gives a damn.  
Nobody listens and no one will understand.  
Yet, I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,  
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering  
Listening to both sides.  
Nobody gives, nobody gives, nobody gives.  
The workers told the unions who blamed it on the government,  
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants,  
Everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent.  
Nobody gives. Nobody gives a damn any more.  
The politicians, unions, workers and the militants,  
The fact of it is nobody gives any more.

Cher,Dressed To Kill,"I slip into my shoes and slide into the night  
I'm on the loose, you're in my sights  
You know it's gonna hurt you  
But it's just no use  
You fall in love, they always do  
And I'm waiting for the next one to fall  
  
I'm dressed to kill and you know that I will  
We're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart  
Our heads will roll and blood will spill  
But how can you resist  
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.  
  
Another lover struggles but it's all in vein  
You wear the scars and lipstick stains  
And he can't even see he's just another one  
It's far too late  
He's too far gone.  
And I'm waiting for the next one to fall...  
  
I'm dressed to kill and you know that I will  
We're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart  
Our heads will roll and blood will spill  
But how can you resist  
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.  
How can you resist  
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.  
  
You know I'm the only one  
I can make you come undone  
You be a part of me, from now until eternity  
  
I'm dressed to kill and you know that I will  
We're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart  
Our heads will roll and blood will spill  
But how can you resist  
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.

Get up everybody and listen to this rhyme  
My name is Everlast and yo, I'm always on time  
I got what it takes to make this groove complete  
And when my DJ is cuttin, he's never missin a beat  
I'm down with the Syndicate and they're down with me  
I'm also down with Divine, Bilal and Quincy D.  
Tairrie B., DJ Lethal and my brother cool Nick  
Kid Jazz, Scratch, Bango and Cutmaster Quick  
I've worked hard and long to master this trade  
And to quote my other song yo, I'm just out to get paid  
So sleep on me now for my time will come  
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one

Everlast is in effect  
Gettin big respect  
Then I collect big checks  
1's, 5's, 10's, 20's  
100 g's and I'm pullin honeys  
Left and right, day and night  
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight  
They're all on my tip to get a sip  
Of this poetical performer that's fully equipped  
But I'm out to get paid, not to get laid  
All across the country my records gettin played  
On radio stations, clubs and on tours  
And after every show I make three encores  
Sleep on me now for my time will come  
Everlast last forever, that's why I'm number one  
I got the knack

I got the knack  
(Ah yeah)  
(Hit me)  
(Alright)  
(Check this out)  
Step up, place your bet and I'll serve you fortune  
But first I must issue just one word of caution  
Dope lyric presentations are my sole notoriety  
Everlast is on the rise movin through society  
My voice is moist recitin choice vocals  
Respected worldwide and feared by locals  
Poppin junk out your punk mouth makin bets  
It's too late for regrets, it's time to pay your debts  
E-v-e-are-l-a-s-t is the name that I bear  
A poetic demi-god with skin that's fair  
So sleep on me now for my time will come  
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one

I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
Now there's too many people in this world tryin to play me  
Like I'm some kind of sucker constantly they disobey me  
Tellin me what's sellin, what kinda records get charted  
Sound like him, sound like her - but they all sound retarded  
Takin very little time to write down a rhyme  
It's confusing to see so many people so blind  
Some think that it's a sell-out rhymin to this beat  
But Everlast can take any groove and make it sound complete  
I got the knack

Runnin' through the heart of a man  
If he gives her all he can give her  
She'll be with him at every bend

And runnin' like the wayward wind  
But you found me desperately driftin'  
And touched my heart and took me in

And in your eyes I see  
Reflections I never knew  
Girl, I'll always be sailin' on a river like you

Where your love runs so deep and true

Genesis,Visions Of Angels,"Standing in a forest gazing at the sun  
Looking at the trees but there's not even one  
See a rippling stream that smiles and then goes by  
Run to feel its comfort but the water's dry.  
  
I see her face and run to take her hand  
Why she's never there I just don't understand  
The trumpets sound my whole world crumbles down  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky.  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye.  
  
As the leaves will crumble so will fall my love  
For the fragile beauty of our lives must fade  
Though I once remember echoes of my youth  
Now I sense no past, no love that ends in love  
  
Take this dream the stars have filled with light  
As the blossom glides like snowflakes from the trees  
In vengeance to a god no-one can reach  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky.  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye.  
  
Ice is moving and the world's begun to freeze  
See the sunlight stopped and deadned by the breeze  
Minds are empty bodies more insensitive  
Some believe that when they die they really live  
  
I believe there never is an end  
God gave up the world its people long ago  
Why she's never there I still don't understand  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky.  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye.

Cause the more  
You try  
The harder  
I'll fight  
To say goodnight

Between us  
Could be over  
With a snap  
Of your fingers

Kenny Rogers,I Will Always Love You,"If I should stay  
I would only be in your way  
So, I'll go but I know  
I'll think of you  
  
Each step of the way  
And I will always love you

So goodbye, please don't you cry  
'Cause we both know I'm not what you need  
And I will always love you  
And I will always love you

And I hope you have all you've dreamed of  
And I wish you joy and happiness  
But above all, I wish you love

Taylor Swift,You Belong With Me,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend

She's going off about something that you said  
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do  
I'm in my room  
It's a typical Tuesday night  
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like  
And she'll never know your story like I do'  
  
But she wears short skirts  
I wear T-shirts  
She's cheer captain  
And I'm on the bleachers

And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans  
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be  
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself  
Hey isn't this easy  
  
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town  
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down  
You say your fine  
I know you better then that  
Hey what you doing with a girl like that  
  
She wears high heels  
I wear sneakers  
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you wake up  
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time  
  
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
  
Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time how could you not know  
Baby, you belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night  
I'm the one who makes you laugh  
When you know you're about to cry  
And I know your favorite songs  
And you tell me about your dreams  
I think I know where you belong  
I think I know it's with me  
  
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
  
Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time

Beauty lives in their innocent glow

You Am I,Pizza Guy,"Grab a six pack for the way home.  
It's only twenty five minutes alone  
At a chance to listen to what you see fit  
Put your tail between your legs and you split

Pop a compilation tape and we'll go  
But every dick that comes from the hills  
Is gonna innundate you still  
Never one to let something go  
To make you hate or cuss at folks you don't know

You hope they never make their movie on time

In the lane  
Snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight

Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say no man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on  
We'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
Until the other kiddies knock him down  
  
When it snows  
Ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way  
Walking in a winter wonderland

Yeah, it's a natural drift alright  
  
And it's coming up out of the blur  
Out of your mind from deep below  
The hidden harmonies discover  
Chaos which means order  
Evolution's not a model of yours  
  
For quietness is stronger than motion and silence is stronger than sound  
We're listening to the tone which is not played  
Nothing is what we want  
Nothing is what we get

Yes, that is the way

You talked yourself into wrong questions  
You don't care about the answers  
You let the others be the good ones  
You're part of the deathbringing system  
  
There's no place where you can hide  
Stop! chasing the wrong gods of time  
I'm running out of time  
Time kills  
  
You're lowering hopes much too much, getting into the grind much too much  
And losing faith in your abilities  
The loyalty to your beloved system of belief must surrender  
To chaos which means order, evolution's not a model of yours  
  
For quietness is stronger than motion

Ramones,I Got You Babe,"They say we're young and we don't know

But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

And when I'm sad, you're a clown  
And if I get scared, you're always around  
  
So let them say your hair's too long  
'Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong

There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Jason Mraz,Running,"I'm running to catch up again  
Jumping higher and flying more often than not  
Your trampoline has got holes in it but I can still see the top  
Let me climb aboard and sample some of next year's fashion  
I'll wear the coat if you can put the hat on, I will wear the coat,  
Just let me clear my throat  
So I can say what's been delayed away  
  
Let me crawl into your lap and just lay here for awhile  
Satisfied by your seduction like a handshake would do the job  
Never know how long I have waited  
Anticipated your smile to be pressed against mine  
Your smile pressed against mine  
Well I feel it. (oh boy  
And I'm gonna settle tight  
  
She could pour me over that sugar hill or mountain  
Until I get that cool breeze, a tight squeeze, I'd do it over again  
And I drink from her ever flowing fountain  
And then I wake up I comb my hair and I hurry it up  
But I arrive late I pack my things and I pick it up  
Well I put down a good amount of deodorant on this morning  
And I found that I could drown a little bit of peace of mind  
Well it's no secret that to some degree they're gonna have to see you sweat  
Strong enough for a man just do what you can to keep me soft and dry  
I stink awhile  
  
I don't know anything about those things  
I almost don't wanna know anything about those things  
Oh I don't care anything about those things  
Cause if I did you know I'd share myself on those things  
And I feel it oh boy  
  
I'll be, i'll be here all night  
I'll pick up the pieces and I put them back together now  
They may not be the right way but that's okay  
As long as they're all the same  
  
I wish you well, well that you'd get better  
And I know you'll find that it's a wild world  
And that's ok 'cause you're a wild girl  
And I took the hits and I turned to shit  
And if you had noticed well would you have thrown the towel in  
Before I missed out on all this love  
And watch me roll away again  
Watch me disappear under my skin  
I don't believe it that things could get any worse than they did that time  
You must have seen it  
I mean how could we get lost running in a straight line  
Your cries of why's and why nots, may it all get back to you  
And trickle and dance upon your headaches  
Years of biting cheeks are through  
So I don't believe in it  
  
But I feel it.

Luther Vandross,Nights In Harlem,"There's a party in Harlem, come on  
  
I like to reminisce about that night we kissed  
It was somewhere one night in Harlem  
The nights were hot and bright  
You could treat your honey right  
?Cause Sylvia's would burn all night  
  
The people there were really something  
(You know that's right)  
The music always kept us jumping  
And it used to knock me down  
When Smokey came to town  
(And the miracles, please)  
My favorite song was ""Tears Of A Clown"", oh yeah  
  
There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
And I'm gonna take my baby back  
To the heart of Harlem  
  
Big sister had a group  
And they'd sit out on the stoop  
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)  
My cousin Joe could blow  
Just like the radio  
And he used to drove them ""B"" girls wild  
  
But when grandma started happy dancing  
(Oh, she gon' break somethin')  
She really turned the mother out  
I like the way they do it up in Harlem  
When there's a party up in Harlem  
That's what it's all about  
  
Ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
And tonight I'm gonna take her back to the 'pollo  
  
There's a party in Harlem  
They say that all the stars will be there  
Everyone is going to Harlem  
Harlem is a party and everybody's going there  
  
Follow me visually, ?cause I usually be all around  
Originally everybody headed uptown  
Finessing the fly way you ?cruisin in your car  
On the West Side to the highway, East Side D-R  
And yes, we are about to set it  
Forget it, I thought you knew  
The Apollo is where I had to go with my crew  
From BMW's to my daddy's Cadillac  
He had the sunroof top wit the diamond in the back  
Check the ambiance, the place a renaissance  
Who frontin' nonchalant up in the restaurant  
What you really really want, we grabbin' by the clutch  
Precise can flaunt with this and never too much  
It's such a love flow, high but natural  
The thug's a no-show, and drugs a no-no  
The only thing that they was shootin' was pool  
While Harlem nights was right, the party was cool  
  
Nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby back to the heart of Harlem  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They don't let you fake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my honey  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby  
Back to the Harlem Apollo

Queensryche,Another Rainy Night,"Don't slam the door, on your way out  
Don't leave without saying goodbye  
Another long distance night alone  
You leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more  
Last word today, coming home to stay?  
Wouldn't that be nice, for a while?  
  
But now my take-out food is growing cold  
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor  
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone  
  
I'm all alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Guess I'll leave a light on for you  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
  
Listen, there's a foghorn blowing  
From the coast tonight  
Remember making love in the rain?  
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound  
Raindrops taste like tears without the pain  
I'm not much without you, can't leave  
If I wanted to. maybe that's why you stay around  
  
But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire  
And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour  
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called  
  
I'm all alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Waiting by the phone, alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Guess I'll leave a light on for you  
  
I know I've said it before  
Hate the sound of the closing door  
And your footsteps walking away  
  
But now my take-out food is growing cold  
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor  
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone  
I'm all alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Waiting by the phone, alone  
And it's another rainy night, without you  
Guess I'll leave a light on for you  
  
It's just another rainy night, another rainy night  
Another rainy night without you

Marillion,This Town,"The cars leave their trails of hot and cold light inside my head  
Like burned-in long exposure pictures  
The wheels spin slowly backwards  
Strobing in the amber light  
And the rain comes down and washes my brain  
But it don't get clean  
  
This town has turned me into what I have become  
This town dresses me up like a stranger  
This town performs in the window like the ultimate gift  
This town takes us down  
I feel like I'm losing you to this town  
  
We were saving our money for half of our lives  
We were saving our dreams  
And we came to this place to make the chances real  
In the big city  
But I've been counting the days  
I've been watching you change  
And I can feel it dying  
The noise outside takes you in its arms  
Like a lamb to a lion  
  
And down there somewhere among the noise  
The magazine dolls and the big money boys  
Move silently on their easy heels  
They move silently on their greasy wheels  
  
This town has turned me into what I have become  
This town dresses you up like a stranger  
This town hangs around in the doorway and tells me I'm late  
This town takes us down, takes us down  
I feel like I'm losing you to this town  
  
The morning breaks and I watch you awake  
This town takes you down away from me again

Looking  
For a part-time kind of love

Start to disappear  
Don't want somebody up and running  
Out here  
'cause when you stop and start  
Baby it's just too hard upon

Now to me  
Somewhere, someday you'll have  
To take a chance

Get up and dance  
  
And if we grow together daring to dream  
I know we'll find our shares of  
Peaches and cream  
And when the juices flow  
I don't want no no no excuses  
Just want your full time love  
For me  
Just want your full time love  
For me.

Is your life real or just pretend?

Rewinds the future to the past  
To find the source of the solution  
The system has to be recast

Fast forward to the secrets of your soul  
Your life's on overload  
Is this your fate?  
  
Will you decide what makes you an entity  
That's your identity  
Well if you don't know  
Which way to go

Transforming time and space beyond control  
Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate  
Don't look back before today- tomorrow is too late

Occupied inside a human host  
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly  
Synthesized until they set you free

This is a 38 pistol built on a 45 frame  
It shoots tombstone bullets an' a ball and chain!""

You're gonna be the first to go!  
You just drive on just like there ain't nothin' happenin'""

And keep a sharp lookout at all times  
While I sneak in that back door""

And said ""Oh there you are!""  
He made a mistake in the dark and ran and leaped in the police car!  
When they put the handcuffs on him  
  
I said: ""Child, your crime must have outgrew him!""  
An' then they said: ""Yeh, we gonna put him so far back in jail this time  
  
That they're gonna have to pump air into him!""  
Well now boy ""reach for the sky""  
Yeah but I said, I don't understand sir  
Don't you try no monkey business, I got a stopper in my hand

Red Hot Chili Peppers,Tear,"This is my time  
This is my tear  
I can see clearly now  
That this is not a place  
For playing solitaire  
Tell me where you want me  
This is my time  
This is my tear  
  
Comin' on strong

All the world gets high  
When you take a dare  
Let it rise before you  
This is my crime

All in all I'm  
Loving every rise and fall  
The sun will make and I will take  
Breath to be sure of this  
In the end  
All will be forgiven when  
Surrender rises high and I  
Gave what I came to give  
Say it now because you never know  
  
Devil may cry devil may care  
Distiller's got a scream  
And now I know just why  
When she's movin' air  
Can you feel the voltage  
This is my time  
California skies  
Got room to spare  
This is my time

Take it outside  
Take it out there  
Seems to me like  
All the world gets high  
When you take a dare  
In the final moment  
This is my time

Patsy Cline,Loose Talk,"So long we've been married  
Life's burdens we've carried  
Though faith kept us humble  
And made our love grow  
The plans that we make up  
Someone seems to break up  
But darlin' what else can we do  
  
[Chorus:]  
We may have to leave here  
To find peace of mind, dear  
Some place where we can live  
A life all our own  
For I know you love me  
And happy we could be  
If some folks would leave us alone  
  
They say you are leaving  
That you are deceiving  
But you tell me they say  
The same about me  
But we'll show them that they're wrong  
That loose talk will do harm  
And hope that the truth they will see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I go out walkin'  
There's lots of loose talkin'  
They say we're unhappy  
And we'll break apart  
But, darling, it's not true  
Because I still love you  
And I do with all of my heart  
Yeah!

Rush,Halo Effect,"What did I see?  
Fool that I was  
A goddess, with wings on her heels  
All my illusions  
Projected on her  
The ideal, that I wanted to see  
  
What did I know?  
Fool that I was  
Little by little, I learned  
My friends were dismayed  
To see my betrayed  
But they knew they could never tell me  
  
What did I care?  
Fool that I was  
Little by little, I burned  
Maybe sometimes  
There might be a flaw  
But how pretty the picture was back then  
  
What did I do?  
Fool that I was  
To profit from youthful mistakes?  
It's shameful to tell  
How often I fell  
In love with illusions again  
  
What did I do?  
Fool that I was  
To profit from youthful mistakes?  
So shameful to tell  
Just how often I fell  
In love with illusions again

King Diamond,The Ritual,"As I look into the eyes of Victoria  
Enter the Puppet Master and his wife  
I can't speak, I'm in shock  
  
Human skulls, ancient books  
A strange symbol on the wall, black candles burning low  
  
In the gloomy light, I see an altar in white  
Oh, what is it for? It must be a Ritual  
  
In glass jars, up on shelves  
I see liquid dark as Hell, there's one for every Puppet  
  
I hear the Master's voice, magic words from ancient times  
I'm feeling strange inside  
Oh, as if something has taken my mind  
  
I hear the Master's voice, magic words from ancient times  
I'm feeling strange inside  
Oh, as if something has taken my mind  
In panic, I kick the shelf, with all the jars  
One of them falls from high above, to the floor  
Red! Oh so red, it's blood  
""How dare you disturb my work""?  
  
Demon skull, red as Blood  
It's in the symbol on the wall, there's something deadly wrong  
  
I feel a sting in my eyes, as they're given eternal life  
All because of the Blood on the floor, interrupted Ritual  
  
I hear the Master's voice, magic words from ancient times  
I'm feeling strange inside  
Oh, as if something has taken my mind  
He lures away my soul, from its shelter and into the cold  
To him my soul is gold  
Trading souls with this Demon is something he knows  
As well as Hell  
Magic life, is his return  
Pain, in my skin, sin  
I feel some kind of Magic, inside

Keith Green,Lies,"When I was young I used to believe everything that I heard, just what I heard.  
But now the only thing that I can believe is gods word, his holy word.  
But even now my doubts will open up for me a world that I just despise.  
And then the shades come down, the light turn off,  
And I'm left alone with my helpless cries.  
When I hear all his lies, all of the devils wicked lies.  
If you believe and your faith just dies.  
Don't you be a fool, don't you even open up,  
Or expose yourself to just one of his wicked lies.  
  
I want to go around the world and prove Jesus lives, you know he lives.  
And were not only friends, were family, were relatives, relatives.  
But when I'm far from home and so alone, and my imagined fears get so over-
sized.  
That's when I listen to the one no one should listen to, and get fooled by his
disguise.  
Feeling weak from his lies, all of his bad wicked lies,  
If you believe and your faith just dies.  
Don't you get fooled, don't you even open up,  
Or expose yourself to just one of his wicked lies.  
  
If you're well read, you probably know how the story goes.  
That wolf can look so good especially dressed in the right clothes, the wooly
clothes.  
And as he starts to knit the counterfeit hell totally make you feel like
you're paralyzed.  
Hell keep you spun around and looking down,  
Just when you should be looking straight to the skies.  
Pleading help from his lies, all of the devils wicked lies.  
If you believe and your faith just dies.  
Don't you be a fool, don't you even open up, or expose yourself,  
To one of his wicked lies, to one of his wicked lies.

Steely Dan,I Can't Function,"I'm working hard from morning 'til night

How do you think it makes me feel?  
Your lashing turn  
It hurts my soul  
I start to think  
And I lose control  
I'm not moving like I know I should  
Or feeling like I'd like to feel  
And I spend my days just fooling around

I gotta make a little fortune  
So I can bring it on home to you

Treating me the way you do

I'm drinking dinner from a paper sack  
Every day is the Fourth of July  
And I'm nothing but an April Fool  
Well I spend my days just cruising around  
I can't function  
Honey when you run me down  
Oh darling don't you run me down  
I'm half a man  
With half a heart  
I hear you laughing  
And I fall apart  
I'd like to put it on the table  
But I'm lost before I even start  
You do me wrong and it's bringing me down  
My idle ways are the talk of the town  
You make me feel like a do-nothing-clown

How he gently and tenderely washed away your sin  
Don't you know that He still cares the way He did back then?  
Do you remember the day you first let Jesus in?

King Diamond,The Storm,"18 was yesterday today she was  
A woman in every single way  
Abigail was walking in the forest where  
The darkness, it seems to be alive  
  
It was hours ago that she left her home  
The chapel in which Black Horsemen saved and raised her soul  
And now in the darkest night a storm was born  
And Abigail, she did not know...she was its prey  
  
Solo: Andy  
  
In the storm itself a monster came alive  
Chasing Abigail, lightning from the sky  
  
Ah...then her face turned white  
Never did she see the EYE that cried  
Raindrops on her head, weeping for the dead, rain...rain...  
Turning red  
  
Oh no...Let me go back to my home...Oh no...  
  
Solo: Mike  
  
God he looked away the night the storm it came  
And Abigail was drawn into the rain  
  
Rain...was pulling on her hair  
To where there is a mansion...THE LAIR  
Lurking in the dark when lightning struck again  
The mansion showed itself...in silhouette  
  
Solo: Mike  
  
Ah...rusty iron gates  
This is where the Little One she waits  
Raindrops on her head, weeping for the dead, rain...rain...rain  
Turning red  
  
Oh no... Let me go back to my home...Oh no... Oh...  
Seeing the Little One...knowing that she was a ghost...  
Abigail wondering why she was  
Mummified...a lantern in her hand  
And in the light she saw a name:

The waves would lash about us

Ever foresee  
That things could so utterly alter?  
  
All the plans that we laid  
Could soon be betrayed  
Betrayed like the rock of gibraltar

Demi Lovato,Don't Forget,"Did you forget  
That I was even alive  
Did you forget  
Everything we ever had  
Did you forget  
Did you forget  
'Bout me  
  
Did you regret  
Ever standing by my side  
Did you forget  
What we were feeling inside  
Now I'm left to forget  
About us  
  
[Chorus]  
But somewhere we went wrong  
We were once so strong  
Our love is like a song  
You can't forget it  
  
So now I guess  
This is where we have to stand  
Did you regret  
Ever holding my hand  
Never again  
Please don't forget  
Don't forget  
  
We had it all  
We were just about to fall  
Even more in love  
Than we were before  
I won't forget  
I won't forget  
About us  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
At all  
  
And at last  
All the pictures have been burned  
And all the past  
Is just a lesson that we've learned  
I won't forget  
Please don't forget about us  
  
But somewhere we went wrong  
Our love is like a song  
But you won't sing along  
You've forgotten  
About us  
Don't forget

Cole  
Cole, world  
Yeah  
Let me take y'all back man  
As I do so well  
  
[Verse 1]  
Wasn't nothin' like that  
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first, time  
She was in my math class  
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass  
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes  
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes  
It started off so innocent  
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it  
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool  
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school  
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her  
Got me daydreaming, man what  
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it  
Make it hard for me to stand up  
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and  
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'  
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before  
She wrote a note that said ""You ever had sex before?""  
Damn  
  
[Hook]  
And I ain't never did this before, no (x8)  
  
[Verse 2]  
I wrote back and said, ""Of course I had sex before,"" knowing I was frontin'  
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowing I was stuntin'  
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out, son  
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one  
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me  
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me  
My mama gone for the weekend  
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""  
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'  
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up  
I'm thinking how that body look naked when you laying on the bed  
Teacher, please don't make me stand up  
I wrote back like ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan""  
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man  
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned  
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin  
Fuck  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You know that feeling when you you finna bone for the first time  
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time  
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with  
And most of all I'm praying, ""God don't let me bust quick""  
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right  
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right  
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'  
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection  
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing  
And a nigga roll over on top  
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing  
On me, ooh girl don't stop  
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I
practiced  
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said  
""I wanna get something off my mental  
I can tell you're a pro, but baby be gentle, cause""

Proclaimers,Over And Done With,"This is the story of our first teacher  
Shetland made her jumpers  
And the devil made her features  
Threw up her bands when my mum said our names  
Embroidered all her stories with slanderous claims  
It's over and done with  
  
This is the story of losing my virginity  
I held my breath and the bed held a trinity  
People I'm making no claims to a mystery  
But sometimes it seems like  
My sex life's all history  
I'm not saying these events didn't  
Touch our lives in any way  
But, ah, they didn't make the impression  
That some people say  
  
This is the story of watching a man dying  
The subjects unpopular  
But I don't feel like lying  
When I think of it now I acted like a sinner  
I just washed my bands  
Then I went for my dinner.

Dusty Springfield,I Can't Give Back The Love I Feel For You,"Here's a tear  
For a souvenir  
And a dream  
Torn at the seams  
Here's a promise that you made to me of love  
It's more than I'll ever see  
And then you're free to go  
  
But I can't give back the love I feel for you  
Gonna be stuck with it no matter what I do  
Take these eyes that once could see  
Now reflections of my misery  
And happiness I thought would last  
Is now becoming just a thing of the past  
  
But I can't give back the love  
That's a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You'll have to take all of me  
  
Simply adore  
'Til the world don't go round no more  
  
Here's the ring  
That didn't mean a thing  
And letters you wrote  
That gave my young heart hope  
Take the pillow where my dreams were made  
And the mind where the thought of you stayed  
But, baby, you should know  
  
That I can't give back the love I feel for you  
Gonna be stuck with it no matter what I do  
Take these arms that held you close  
And follow up the one you need the most  
Take these hands no good to me  
That used to touch you so tenderly  
  
But I can't give back the love  
That's a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You'll have to take all of me  
  
No, I can't give back the love that I feel for you, yeah  
Gonna be stuck with it no matter, no matter what I do  
No, I can't give back the love that's a part of me, yeah  
Gonna be stuck with it no matter, no matter what I, what I do  
Gonna get stuck

Keeps revealing you, you

In the silence of my lonely room

Burning inside of me

Sneaked inside, locked the door to his own room to hide, picked it up,

Kris Kristofferson,"I'm Down, But I Keep Falling","Written by Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge  
  
Hey, fairweather friend,  
You know you can bend me  
I don't wanna break  
Hey, lend me a hand  
Something I can lean on  
'Til I'm strong enough to  
Make it...  
  
'Cause I'm lost, but I'll be lookin'  
I've been hurt, but I keep on hopin'  
'Cause I'm down, but I keep fallin'  
Fall in love with you  
Fall in love with you.  
  
Take all you can find  
Any way you want to  
Easy as you can  
Leave something behind  
Love enough to live on  
'Til I'm strong enough to stand it  
On my own...  
  
But I'll be lookin'  
All alone--but I keep on hopin'  
'Cause I'm down, but I keep fallin'  
Fall in love with you  
Fall in love with you.......

How we do  
Yo  
All of my rhymes fall all of my days I trade  
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade  
Killing late nights cruisin'  
All you see is the break lights  
And hair blowing you know where we going  
Or at the club in the rear frontin'  
Poppin droppin'  
The amounts of cats but we aint trying to hear nothing  
Probably was wilder than wobbly are you the wiggy to give me  
Hold me down and make me slow down to be twissy  
Keep the ice out the club life - change face  
Get on love wife while he on the license plates  
Wait - make me think about you even when your not around  
Use the bathroom put the toilet seat back down  
Got me some sprinkles the hair with the wrinkles  
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles  
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways  
Jigga keep me jiggy all of my days

In the middle of the night  
Got me thinkin' bout cha babe  
Got me dreamin' about cha baby

Baby it's yours  
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby  
All I want is to be with you all of my days  
All I want all I need  
All I want is to be with you all of my days  
All I want baby

Keep it on the low are Kelly style it's quite shockin'  
A year ago all I did was spend nights hoppin'  
In the club in search of pretty faces and night stalkers  
Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle  
Rice droppin' got you a nice rock and...  
Now it's on and poppin' droppin' holiday platinum bracelets  
Jigga - are Kelly - Changing Faces  
Uh

Evanescence,Restless,"She embraced  
With a smile  
As she opened the door  
A cold wind blows  
It puts a chill  
Into my heart  
  
You have taken away the trust  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
Past and present are one in her head  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
  
Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my life I gave to you  
Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my love I gave to you

Reba Mcentire,I Want A Cowboy,"Everybody told me he was a dream  
Picture perfect like he stepped right off the silver screen  
Said that he would sweep me off my feet  
But I'm still standing no he didn't do it for me  
'cause I don't go for all that wine and dine  
With the ray ban fake tan never mind  
  
I want a down home up with the sun rise man  
A pick-up truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  
I want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  
I want the real McCoy  
I want a cowboy  
  
I'm tired of talking 'bout it wasting my time  
On all the cheap talkers needing me feeding me lines  
Give me somebody who's tender but tough  
Simple and honest knows a thing or two about love  
I've seen enough to know I know what I like  
It's the hard working head turning rugged type  
  
I want a down home up with the sun rise man  
A pick-up truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  
I want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  
I want the real McCoy  
I want a cowboy  
  
I've seen enough to know you know what I mean  
Ride me off into the sunset that's my thing  
  
I want a down home up with the sun rise man  
A pick-up truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  
I want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  
I want the real McCoy

Rush,Seven And Seven Is,"When I was a boy I thought about the times I'd be a man  
I'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in a jam  
In my lonely room I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone  
You can throw me if you want to 'cause I'm a bone and I go  
  
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!  
  
If I don't start cryin' it's because that I have got no eyes  
My father's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized  
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way  
Trapped inside a night but I'm a day and I go  
  
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!

Run down my face?

Please comfort me before I go insane

Randy Travis,A Little Left Of Center,"I walk in the rain and whistle a tune  
I talk to the man up there in the moon  
I know I may sound like somebody gone insane  
I'm a fool about you baby but my heart can't explain  
  
It's a little left of center  
By heavenly design  
Love gets carried away  
And goes wild at times  
When cupid aims his arrow  
It's right on the mark  
A little left of center  
Just like my crazy heart  
  
It leaps like a frog when you touch my hand  
It means like a drum in a marching band  
Can't help what it does I just follow where it leads  
How my heart feels about you baby makes perfect sense to me  
  
It's a little left of center  
By heavenly design  
Love gets carried away  
And goes wild at times  
When cupid aims his arrow  
It's right on the mark  
A little left of center  
Just like my crazy heart  
  
When cupid aims his arrow  
It's right on the mark  
A little left of center  
Just like my crazy heart

Everything's so pretty I see  
I get a feeling that I never knew  
Every time that I look at you.

In you arms heaven is mine  
I always see a dream come true  
Every time that I look at you.

The candle gutters on the ledge  
Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing  
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running  
  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured

And gone are the days of rainbows  
And gone are the nights of swinging from the stars  
For the sea will swallow up the mountains  
And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks  
  
Straight at you  
But I'll come a-running  
Straight to you  
But I'll come a-running

Heaven has denied us its kingdom  
The saints are drunk and howling at the moon  
The chariots of angels are colliding

Linkin Park,Enth E Nd,"Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park...  
Then in the middle came Motion Man...  
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix [echo]  
  
One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time  
All I know, time was just slipping way  
  
And I watched it count down till the end of the day  
Watched it watch me and the words that I say  
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins  
I know that I didn't look out below  
  
And I watched the time go right out the window  
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch  
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock  
But in the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time  
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party  
  
All for shake and made eye contact  
Party control showing all that  
Northeast, southwest coast  
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle  
  
I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder  
I brought you back of the thing  
Like the imaginary man of your dreams  
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it  
  
A sleek skin I never nerved you  
You felt lovin, I never applied a room  
Without bringing the plan  
By any means and means of leaving you teens,  
Of all those teenage scenes, I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man  
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt  
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man  
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt  
  
One thing I don't know how  
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now  
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all  
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl  
  
And I was forced to run, with you mocking me  
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly  
Remembering all those times you fought with me  
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy  
  
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale  
Every single little thing you said and make it expel  
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't
matter to me  
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter..  
In the end

Oh I should've known from the start  
That, you'd go and tear it apart  
Oh and now you've deserted me  
  
You never lose, you never fail  
You always live to tell the tale

When will you come back to me?

Emmylou Harris,In My Hour Of Darkness,"In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Once I knew a young man  
Went driving through the night  
Miles and miles without a word  
With just his high-beam lights  
  
Who'd have ever thought  
They'd build such a deadly Denver bend  
To be so strong, to take so long  
As it would till the end  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Another young man safely strummed  
His silver string guitar  
And he played to people everywhere  
Some say he was a star  
  
But he was just a country boy  
His simple songs confess  
And the music he had in him  
So very few possess  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Then there was an old man  
Kind and wise with age  
And he read me just like a book  
And he never missed a page  
  
And I loved him like my father  
And I loved him like my friend  
And I knew his time would shortly come  
But I did not know just when  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed

Seems you've lost your faith in everyone you know  
Well I surely hope that you don't plan on winnin'

Look around your room you find the paint is peelin'  
Your reflective skin is fallin' off your bones

What he had done

Far from the far side  
Though she had pleaded  
With him each night  
But not a word did  
She ever utter  
That told her heartaches  
Her smile was bright

You can remember  
She's gone to heaven  
From heartache's free  
Them bars around you  
Will never change her

An error will be

Not for spitting on  
This one's from the hip  
My love I should have warned you about me  
It never got whipped  
Out of me  
Me and my modesty and  
Mother your wretched son won't  
Take his medicine  
Not I  
I don't care anymore  
I'm sick and I'm tired  
And I don't care anymore  
This one's from the hip  
Why should I know why?  
It's a wicked world  
I've had it up to here  
Sweet jesus I should have warned you about me  
It's sure to end in tears  
And misery  
Without a father figured I  
Yeh I concluded then that I'm  
Not for spitting on  
Not I...  
Why should I know why should I care?  
Who's telling me what I should wear?  
Mother your wretched son is hooked on his medicine  
I don't care anymore  
I'm sick and I'm tired  
And I don't care anymore  
This one's from the hip  
Why should I know why

Demi Lovato,It's Not Too Late,"Oh  
Here I am  
Feels like the walls are closing in  
Once again it's time to face it and be strong  
I wanna do the right thing now  
I know it's up to me somehow  
I've lost my way  
  
If I could take it all back I would now  
I never meant to let you all down  
And now I've got to try to turn it all around  
And figure out how to fix this  
I know there's a way so I promise  
I'm gonna clean up this mess I made  
Maybe it's not to late  
Maybe it's not to late, oh  
  
So I'll take a stand  
Even though it's complicated  
If I can I wanna change the way I've made it  
I've gotta do the right thing now  
I know it's up to me somehow  
I'll find my way

Patti Smith,Radio Baghdad,"Suffer not Your neighbor's affliction  
Suffer not Your neighbor's paralysis  
But extend your hand Extend your hand  
Lest you vanish in the city And be but a trace  
Just a vanished ghost And your legacy  
All the things you knew Science, mathematics, thought  
Severely weakened Like irrigation systems  
In the tired veins forming From the Tigris and Euphrates  
In the realm of peace All the world revolved  
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle  
City of Baghdad City of scholars  
Empirical humble Center of the world  
City in ashes City of Baghdad  
City of Baghdad Abrasive aloof  
  
Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep  
Deep in the veins of the great rivers  
That form the base Of Eden  
And the tree The tree of knowledge  
Held up its arms To the sky  
All the branches of knowledge All the branches of knowledge  
Cradling Cradling  
Civilization In the realm of peace  
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle  
Oh Baghdad Center of the world  
City of ashes With its great mosques  
Erupting from the mouth of god Rising from the ashes like  
a speckled bird Splayed against the mosaic sky  
Oh, clouds around We created the zero  
But we mean nothing to you You would believe  
That we are just some mystical tale We are just a swollen belly  
That gave birth to Sinbad, Scheherazade We gave birth  
Oh, oh, to the zero The perfect number  
We invented the zero And we mean nothing to you  
Our children run through the streets  
And you sent your flames Your shooting stars  
Shock and awe Shock and awe  
Like some, some Imagined warrior production  
Twenty-first century No chivalry involved  
No Bushido  
  
Oh, the code of the West Long gone  
Never been Where does it lie?  
You came, you came Through the west  
Annihilated a people And you come to us  
But we are older than you You come you want to  
You want to come and rob the cradle  
Of civilization And you read yet you read  
You read Genesis You read of the tree  
You read of the tree Beget by god  
That raised its branches into the sky Every branch of knowledge  
Of the cradle of civilization  
  
Of the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates  
Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep  
The face of Eve turning What sky did she see  
What garden beneath her feet The one you drill  
You drill Pulling the blood of the earth  
Little droplets of oil for bracelets Little jewels  
Sapphires You make bracelets  
Round your own world We are weeping tears  
Rubies We offer them to you  
We are just Your Arabian nightmare  
We invented the zero But we mean nothing to you  
Your Arabian nightmare  
  
City of stars  
City of scholarship  
Science City of ideas  
City of light City  
City of ashes That the great Caliph  
Walked through His naked feet formed a circle  
And they built a city  
A perfect city of Baghdad  
In the realm of peace  
And all the world revolved  
And they invented And they mean nothing to you  
Nothing to you Nothing  
  
Go to sleep Go to sleep my child  
Go to sleep And I'll sing you a lullaby  
A lullaby for our city A lullaby of Baghdad  
Go to sleep Sleep my child  
Sleep Sleep  
Run Run  
  
You sent your lights Your bombs  
You sent them down on our city Shock and awe  
Like some crazy T.V. show  
  
They're robbing the cradle of civilization  
They're robbing the cradle of civilization  
They're robbing the cradle of civilization  
  
Suffer not The paralysis of your neighbor  
Suffer not But extend your hand

Taylor Swift,Our Song,"I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car  
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel  
The other on my heart  
I look around, turn the radio down  
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""  
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""  
And he said,  
  
Our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow  
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date  
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have  
And when I got home, before I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
  
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day  
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on  
And lost and thrown away  
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed  
I almost didn't notice all the roses  
And the note that said,  
  
Our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow  
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date  
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have  
And when I got home, before I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
  
I've heard every album, listened to the radio  
Waited for something to come along  
That was as good as our song  
  
'Cause our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window  
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow  
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know  
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date  
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have  
And when I got home, before I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah  
  
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone  
In the front seat of his car  
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin  
And I wrote down our song

Squeeze,Within These Walls Of Without You,"Within these walls of without you  
I feel naked and without a friend  
Love was once there all around you  
Now I feel our relationship end  
I can't put my finger on a reason  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall  
  
Within these walls a heart broken  
And memories of a holiday  
The sea leaves my heart so unspoken  
With the lights folding up on the waves  
  
I don't think I'll ever have the answer  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall  
  
No unhappy memories are there of you  
When I close my eyes I see  
An image of your love forever true  
But not forever for me  
  
I don't think I'll ever have the answer  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall

'michael, they are taking you away.  
For you stole travelyns corn,  
So the young might see the morn,  
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay. '  
  
Chorus  
  
Low lie the fields of athenry  
Where once we watched the small freebirds fly.  
Our love was on the wing,  
We had dreams and songs to sing  
It's so lonely rond the fields of athenry  
  
By a lonely prison wall  
I heard a young man calling  
'nothing matters, mary when you're free  
Against the famine and the crown,  
I rebelled, they cut me down,  
Now you must raise our child with dignity. '  
  
Chorus  
  
By a lonely harbour wall,  
As she watched the last star falling  
As the prison ship said out against the sky  
For she lived in hope and prayed,  
For her love in botany bay  
It's so lonely round the fields of athenry

Travis,Good Day To Die,"Where is your mother,  
Where is your father,  
Two little children,  
Locked in the cupboard,  
Into the wide world,  
High on the high wire  
  
What would you give to fly away,  
Away, away, away, away,  
Girl with the flower,  
Boy with the hammer,  
Lost in a forest,  
On another planet,  
Find me the exit,  
Find them the way home  
  
Find all the love they took away,  
Away, away, away, away,

And your heart is a football,  
And your eyes broken windows,  
When you cry,  
It's a good day to die  
  
And your head is a brick wall,

A single thing that we went through,

And you could live your life without me if you had to  
And you believe that in the end it all works out right

The planets all lined up and built a new house  
And everything we talked about felt like a prophecy  
And when you looked at me they all came true  
And if you asked which one wants to go the distance  
I do.  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
My cryin's through, I'm moving on.

I'm gonna dip into your memory and take a good stiff drink  
And when I'm drunk on the last drop of sadness about how we went wrong  
I'm gonna play this song  
Make some coffee black and strong  
Give thanks for healing time  
Finally make up my mind  
These are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
Baby my cryin's through, I'm moving on.  
I don't regret and won't forget

The join in jumpin' it's really somethin'  
The beat is pumpin', my heart is thumpin'  
Spent my money on you honey  
My limbs are shakin', my heart is breakin'  
  
You had a white rag wrapped around your head  
Wearing a long dress fire engine red  
I had a dream about you, baby  
Had a dream about you, baby  
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.

Jilly's on smack, and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back, for the holidays

Went to pick her own bone  
She made her own  
In the marketplace

Now Jilly's on smack, and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back  
For the holidays  
  
Jilly had a smile  
That spanned over a mile  
She left him standing in the aisles  
Of the big parade  
  
Jilly always phoned her mother  
Emailed daily to her brother  
'Til she took a junkie lover  
And began to fade  
  
Now Jilly's on smack, and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back

Gary Numan,The 1930's Rust,"Listen good

Don't cry anymore  
  
Now just shut your mouth  
This point of view  
Appeals to me  
  
Listen babe

Same old smile  
That cracked a thousand hearts  
But not mine  
  
Same old line  
I've read the book  
And I know you well  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight  
  
What's this feeling  
That I don't believe  
No concern on my face  
  
What's it for  
You dream of something  
Like I dreamed of you

Aerosmith,Make It,"Good evening people, welcome to the show  
Got something here I want you all to know  
When laughin' people bring on primal screams  
You got to think of what it's gonna take to make your dreams  
Make it  
Don't break it  
I said make it  
Don't break it  
Do then ya feel like the world's coming down on you  
You know that history repeats itself  
But you just learned so by somebody else  
You know you do, you gotta think up fast  
You gotta figure what it's gonna take to make it last  
Make it  
Don't fake it  
Said make it  
Don't fake it  
Better weather, pull yourself together  
Don't be catchin' the blues  
Better weather, pull yourself together

You're only paying your dues  
If you're gone I'll get you anyway  
Although you know what you've been going through

The Jam,Ghosts,"Why are you frightened can't you see that it's you  
That ain't no ghost it's a reflection of you  
Why do you turn away an' keep it out of sight  
Oh don't live up to your given roles  
There's more inside you that you won't show  
  
But you keep it hidden just like everyone  
You're scared to show you care it'll make you vulnerable  
So you wear that ghost around you for disguise  
  
But there's no need just 'cause it's all we've known  
There's more inside you that you haven't shown  
  
So keep on moving, moving, moving your feet  
Keep on shuf-shuf-shuffling to this ghost dance beat  
Just keep on walking down never ending streets  
  
One day you'll walk right out of this life  
And then you'll wonder why you didn't try  
  
To spread some loving all around  
Old fashioned causes like that still stand  
Gotta rid this prejudice that ties you down  
  
How do you feel at the end of the day  
Just like you've waked over your own grave  
  
So why are you frightened can't you see that it's you  
At the moment there's nothing so there's nothing to lose  
Lift up your lonely heart and walk right on through

Kenny Rogers,Coat Of Many Colors,"Back through the years  
I go wandering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall the box of rags  
Someone gave us  
And how my mama put the rags to use  
There were rags of many colors  
Every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat  
And it was away down in the fall  
Mama sewed the rags together  
So in every piece with luck  
She made my coat of many colors  
That I was so proud of  
As she sewed, she told a story  
From the Bible she had read  
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore  
And then she said,  
Perhaps this coat  
Will bring you good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And my mama blessed it with a kiss  
My coat of many colors  
That my mama made for me  
Made only from rags  
That I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
Well, I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
And no, I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them all the story  
Mama told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
""But one is only poor  
Only if he chooses to be.""  
Now I know we had no money  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
Made just for me

Neil Young,I Wonder If I Care As Much,"I wonder if I care as much  
As I did before  
  
Last night I cried myself to sleep  
For the one that makes me weep  
I dried my eyes to greet the day,  
And wondered why I had to pay  
The tears that I have shed by day  
Give relief and wash away  
The memory of the night before  
I wonder if I'll suffer more  
  
I wonder if I care as much  
As I did before  
  
My pride is made to say forgive,  
And take the blame for what you did,  
It's your mistakes I'm thinkin' of,  
I wonder if I'm still in love.  
My heart can't thrive on misery,  
My life it has no destiny,  
When things get more  
Than I can bear,  
I ask myself ""Do I still care?""  
I wonder if I care as much  
As I did before

Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock and roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll.

Neil Sedaka,Perfect Strangers,"An afternoon of sad affairs  
Shared in the hope of mending broken dreams  
The constant struggle after simple pleasures  
Finds us perfect strangers, you and I  
  
You know I hate to see you cry  
And through the tears that fall like winter rain  
You say you're tired of merely just surviving  
We've so much in common that we're  
  
[Chorus:]  
Perfect strangers singing perfectly in tune  
From separate corners of the room  
Held together by our hunger to get by  
Perfect strangers, you and I  
  
Let's make a toast to no regrets  
Wet down the painful sting of sweet love lost  
Let evening find us whispering in our whiskey  
Come and sit beside me for a while  
  
You know I love to see you smile  
And if perhaps you're only passing through  
At least we tried to reach an understanding  
And for just one moment we were  
  
[Chorus x 2]

Stevie Wonder,Happy Birthday,"You know it doesn't make much sense  
There ought to be a law against  
Anyone who takes offense  
At a day in your celebration  
'Cause we all know in our minds  
That there ought to be a time  
That we can set aside  
To show just how much we love you  
And I'm sure you would agree  
It couldn't fit more perfectly  
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
I just never understood  
How a man who died for good  
Could not have a day that would  
Be set aside for his recognition  
Because it should never be  
Just because some cannot see  
The dream as clear as he  
That they should make it become an illusion  
And we all know everything  
That he stood for time will bring  
For in peace our hearts will sing  
Thanks to Martin Luther King  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Why has there never been a holiday  
Where peace is celebrated  
All throughout the world  
The time is overdue  
For people like me and you  
Who know the way to truth  
Is love and unity to all God's children  
It should never be a great event  
And the whole day should be spent  
In full remembrance  
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people  
So let us all begin  
We know that love can win  
Let it out don't hold it in  
Sing it loud as you can  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday  
Ooh yeah  
Happy birthday  
We know the key to unify all people  
Is in the dream that you had so long ago  
That lives in all of the hearts of people  
That believe in unity  
We'll make the dream become a reality  
I know we will  
Because our hearts tell us so

Van Morrison,Here Comes The Knight,"On the road with my sword  
And my shield in my hand  
Pressing on to the new day  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
  
In the valley I see horsemen pass  
Baby, baby, baby they don't want this love to last  
There's a battle for the throne  
And it's raging down in your soul  
It says this love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
  
I've been accused of truth and alchemy  
I've been accused of speaking out for freedom too  
I give a demonstration in front of a crowd  
A man saw my hands move and he began to shout  
  
Here come, here come, her come horsemen through the pass  
They say cast a cold eye on life, on death  
There's a battle for the truth  
And it means to thine own self be true  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always

Violent Femmes,Cold Canyon,"Travel 'round the country  
Look out for what I can get  
Another blessed highway  
Hey mister you're gonna regret  
  
'Cause you just reminded me of something  
I long to forget  
But no matter how much he drink or smoke  
My memory's still clear  
  
It hurts me dear  
It's sharp today like it was yesterday  
No I don't have much hope  
Just the other night I came  
  
Face to face with my past  
Came down like a lightning bolt  
Struck me with a flash  
I was praying all along  
  
That it would not last  
Oh stop it stop it stop it stop it  
Y'know the last time you rang  
I nearly died I almost cried  
  
I put my pride in my pockets  
And said you gotta stay cool cool cool  
Y'know some things just gotta hang  
Oh Lord Lord  
  
Take me back  
I'm going back  
The long track  
So do yourself a favor  
  
And leave me if you please  
I'm in a cold cold canyon  
With a cold cold canyon breeze  
Woke up in a strange room  
  
And then I saw a door  
I went right over and opened it  
Though I'd never been there before  
Started presiding over the meeting  
  
The chairman said I had the floor  
And when we adjourned everyone  
Was satisfied  
We all got our money  
  
Then went out where it was sunny  
But it was kind of funny  
To find out that I was such a dummy  
But there's no place you can really hide

And how things look that way when you're  
Love  
I love this world  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
  
I opened up the letter that the  
Postman gave to me this morning  
Had to stop myself from shouting out  
""I love this world""  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
  
I know that heaven waits  
For those whose love is true  
I want to be there when  
The age love is come again  
  
Tell me all about yourself  
And how you came to me like in a dream  
And every night I dream of you  
I dream of you  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
  
I know that heaven waits  
For those whose love is true  
Don't ask me where or when  
The time for us will come again  
  
I sit and watch the sun go down  
And in the darkness there's no sound  
While in the sky tonight the stars all cry ""I love  
You""  
Are they crying out over you  
''cause you're in my heart  
Is this heaven?  
''cause the story starts and ends with you

Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer  
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere  
But I hear another rum beating for the dead that rise  
Whom nature's beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes  
They tell me revenge is sweet, I'm sure it is  
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized  
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel  
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel  
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
flies  
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

Conway Twitty,All My Life,"Maybe it's the way you kiss me  
Or that twinkle in your eye  
Maybe it's the way you hold me  
And keep me satisfied  
Just as long as you love me  
I guess it doesn't matter why  
You're the one I've dreamed of  
All my life.  
  
Maybe it's the way I sometimes catch you  
With my reflection in your eyes  
Maybe it's the times I tease you  
And you laugh until you cry  
Just as long as you love me

You're the one I've dreamed of  
All my life.

Why this whole world

I walked two steps  
They called me bad feet  
Oh when will this world ever let me be  
Can't understand  
Why this whole world  
Is taking so long  
It's making me strong  
Somebody said  
Well just turn your cheek  
What you've got to know  
That it's making me weak  
Can't understand  
Why this whole world  
Is pulling me down to the ground  
Unchain my head  
Please unchain my feet  
And please let me walk  
With these steady feet  
With these steady feet  
With these steady feet  
Oh please let me walk

Don Henley,If Dirt Were Dollars,"Walkin' like a millionaire  
Smilin' like a king  
He leaned his shopping cart against the wall  
He said, ""I been a lot of places  
And I seen a lot of things  
But, sonny, I seen one thing that beats 'em all  
I was flyin' back from Lubbock  
I saw Jesus on the plane...or maybe it was Elvis  
You know, they kinda look the same  
Hey, look out, Junior, you're steppin' on my bed""  
I said, ""I don't see nothin""  
He just glared at me and said,  
If dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
I wouldn't worry anymore  
Lookin' like a beauty queen  
Loyal as a wife  
She raised her little voice and testified,  
""I am a good girlI've been one all my life""  
But her virtue was as swollen as her pride  
She should've had the Oscar  
She must have been miscast  
Her fifteen minutes went by so fast  
I said, ""Now, baby, have you got no shame?""  
She just looked at me, uncomprehendingly  
Like cows at a passing trainIf dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
I wouldn't worry anymore  
We got the bully pulpit  
And the poisoned pen  
We got a press no better  
Than the public men  
This brave new world  
Gone bad again  
God's finest little creatures  
Looking brave and strong  
Whistling past the graveyard  
Nothing can go wrong  
Quoting from the scriptures  
With patriotic tears  
We got the same old men  
With the same old fears  
Standing at attention  
Wrapped in stars and stripes  
They hear the phantom drummers  
And the nonexistent pipes  
These days the buck stops nowhere  
No one takes the blame  
But evil is still evilIn anybody's name  
If dirt were dollarsIf dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
We'd all be in the black

It will again  
A voice beyond the wind  
Says we must go  
Beyond the end

Vaya con dios

To some new world  
We'll be revealing

Say we must go  
Beyond the end  
And follow

Something's taken hold of me somehow

Give me the time to understand

I have my ways and you have your ways

We can just enjoy that sweet sensation

Marianne Faithfull,It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels,"As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playing  
That old song about the wild, wild side of life.  
As I listen to the words you are saying,  
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you say in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women,  
It's not true that only you, men, feel the same.  
From the start most every heart that's been broken  
Was because there always was a man to blame.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels

Nat King Cole,A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square,"That certain night, the night we met,  
There was magic abroad in the air.  
There were angels dining at the ritz,  
And a nightingale sang in berkeley square.  
  
I may be right, i may be wrong,  
But i'm perfectly willing to swear  
That when you turned and smiled at me,  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.  
  
The moon that lingered over londontown  
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown.  
How could he know that we two were so in love?  
The whole darn world seemed upside down.  
  
The streets of town were paved with stars,  
It was such a romantic affair.  
And as we kissed and said goodnight,  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.  
  
When dawn came stealing up, all gold and blue  
To interrupt our rendez-vous,  
I still remember how you smiled and said,  
""was that a dream? or was it true?""  
  
Our homeward step was just as light  
As the dancing of fred astaire,  
And like an echo far away  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.

Uriah Heep,Dreammare,"Grinning demons, smiling sideways  
Laughing in my face  
Here within my troubled sleep  
There's such a lonely place  
Running fast but never moving  
I can't get away  
Strange but realistic objects  
Making me their prey  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Evil dream  
Changing like the sun turn to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Dining with the gods of beauty  
On a distant shore  
Tasting fruits of untold sweetness  
Never seen before  
Dancing stars with crystal voices  
Beckon with their eyes  
Unicorn of many colours  
Rides to paradise  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Sleepless nights that last a lifetime  
Crucify my head  
Dreams of peace and then disaster  
Wish that I were dead  
Looking for the end of darkness  
Seeking out the day  
For escape with speed unthought of  
Bearing me away  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Come into my dream

Metallica,The Day That Never Comes,"Born to push you around  
Better just stay down  
You pull away  
He hits the flesh  
You hit the ground  
  
Mouth so full of lies  
Tend to block, your eyes  
Just keep them closed  
Keep praying  
Just keep awaiting  
  
Waiting for the one  
The day that never comes  
When they stand up and feel the warmth  
But the sunshine never comes, no  
No, the sunshine never comes  
  
Push you cross that line  
Just stay down this time  
Hide in yourself  
Crawl in yourself  
You'll have your time  
  
God I'll make them pay  
Take it back one day  
I'll end this day  
I'll splatter color on this grave

The day that never comes  
When they stand up and feel the warmth  
But the sunshine never comes

And never spoken here  
Love is a four letter word  
Here in this prison

The sun will shine

Tom Jones,Ghost Riders In The Sky,"An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day  
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw  
A ploughin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel  
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry  
  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat  
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet  
'Cause they got to ride forever on that range up in the sky  
On horses snortin' fire as they ride on hear their cry  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
  
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name  
If you want to save your soul from hell a ridin' on our range  
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride  
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

Fatboy Slim,That Old Pair Of Jeans,"Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah

All you used to do was put me down  
But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground  
And all you used to do was criticize me  
But now I found the good and I emphasise, ya see  
  
You would always get so sensitive  
And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness  
But now I'm certain of the way I live  
And what I'm responsible for in this twisted game  
  
And it's such a shame  
That you try to make pain  
Another word for my name  
Whether giving or receiving  
It's one the same  
Just one more link  
In your long-ass chain  
But it's time to break  
This frame and my strengthful will  
Time to jump off this negative cycle we've built  
Gave my heart  
But my self-respection you won't steal  
Now it's time to let ya know if you can hear me feel me  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
So I asked my mama for her two cents  
And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend  
Then I asked my papa once and I asked him again  
Came two little consensus from all them opinions  
That life is too short to be unhappy  
And since I know what I'm worth there'll be no settling for dirt  
Knowing what I deserve is gold  
If I want diamonds then I can't settle for coal  
  
Maybe I was just too strong to let go  
Maybe I was just too weak to let it show  
Maybe I was just too stubborn to say ""No""  
But whatever the case I can't take it no more  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah

Sometimes I think maybe we'll patch it all up  
Like a favourite pair of jeans that you won't give up on  
Or maybe one of these arguments will make up  
And start again like when we started this up  
Back when everything was fresh  
And every moment a blessing  
I'd laugh at all of your jokes  
You'd listen to my suggestions  
One mind, one soul,  
With common decimation  
Now we can't help but fight over the direction

In front of Waverley, but unfortunately,  
I lost his address.  
He was last seen with his friend,  
A drummer, he resembles George Harrison of the Beatles,  
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back.  
I love him but it embarrasses me,  
To walk down the street with him.  
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere,  
And wears a white crash helmet.  
He has gold chains on his leather jacket,  
And on the back are written the names,  
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels"".  
I would gratefully appreciate it,  
If you see him, tell him,  
I'm in the park with my girlfriend.  
And please,  
Tell him Angela and I don't want the 2 dollars back,  
Just him.

When love struck you down  
You thought that you were bound to die  
From all the pain inside  
When love struck you down  
  
When they were handing out the brains  
You were at the head of the queue  
But once she got inside your heart  
They were no use to you  
When love struck you down  
No one else was fooled  
Fear and madness ruled  
When love struck you down  
  
You weren't there  
When she was everywhere  
Her face, her name  
But no matter what you said  
She never felt the same

Oh how hard you prayed  
But God didn't come to your aid

Until I found the one I'd screwed  
And then it came as clear as mud

And saw the faults where there were none  
Deep in the vaults where love begun  
  
When she said stuff yourself, don't be a clown  
Paint your wagon and take yourself right out of town

Then she said get a grip and shake this mood  
Get a life and find yourself some attitude

God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life and just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why  
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you  
  
[Verse 3]  
In your arms I'm someone new  
With ever tender kiss from you  
Oh must confess  
I've been blessed  
  
[Chorus]  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life and just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why (didn't know why)  
Now I do (I finally do), 'cause God gave me you (God gave me You)

God gave me you

Pogues,Bright Lights,"The bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
As the world is round, road is long  
Trouble on my mind  
I'll just keep on moving  
Till the day comes 'round  
Wind a' blowing on my back  
And my feet a' flying  
Flying down the road  
Where the bright lights shine  
Monday's in a pigtown  
Tuesday's in a truck  
Wednesday's a field of mud  
And Thursday's out of luck  
Friday's rain clouds  
Saturday flies by  
Sunday comes shining  
From a blue, blue sky  
The bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
Some towns are golden  
Some towns are stained  
Some towns are shadows  
Fading in the rain  
Some towns are rust  
And some towns they gleam  
Some towns are mad dogs  
Some towns are a dream  
The bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
Some dreams are hollow  
Some dreams are cold  
Some dreams are crazy  
And some dreams are bold  
Some dreams are bought  
And other dreams are sold  
Some dreams lie waiting  
At the end of the road  
Where the bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
I said the bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me

Matt Redman,The Wonderful Cross,"When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of Glory died  
My richest gain I count but loss  
And pour contempt on all my pride  
  
See from His head, His hands, His feet  
Sorrow and love flow mingled down  
Did ever such love and sorrow meet  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown  
  
Oh the wonderful cross, Oh the wonderful cross  
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live  
Oh the wonderful cross, Oh the wonderful cross  
All who gather here by grace draw near and bless Your name  
  
Were the whole realm of nature mine  
That were and offering far too small  
Love so amazing, so divine  
Demands my soul, my life, my all

I've been in the closet and feel all right  
Ran out of Carbona Mom threw out the glue  
Ran out of paint and roach spray too

Mom and pop want to put me away  
From the early morning movie to the late late show  
After it's over nowhere to go  
And I'm not sorry for the things I do  
  
My brain is stuck from shooting glue  
I'm not sorry for the things I do

Just for a day  
From your body  
Wouldn't want to be swept away  
Far away from the one that I love  
  
Hold me now  
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry  
I just want you to know  
Hold me now  
I really want to tell you I'm sorry  
I could never let you go

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

Ten somersaults he'll undertake on solid ground  
Having been some days in preparation  
A splendid time is guaranteed for all  
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

Modern Talking,Don't Let It Get You Down,"I'm crying through the night  
A cry of loneliness  
Strangers side by side looking for a kiss

Oh like a broken toy  
Oh blue eyes, don't cry  
Your heart is out of tune  
These tears can never dry  
I'll save your heart, babe, soon  
Oh baby give a try  
A sound of breakin' hearts  
I hear again and again  
Oh, I'll be there  
Take my helping hand  
  
Don't let it get you down  
It's never too late  
Don't leave this heartbreak town  
Feel the love we'll make  
Harder you'll try the more you get  
Oh your heartbeat is too sad  
Come keep your heart just burning in the night  
For you and me  
  
You're tired of been alone  
But time is on your side  
You'll make it on your own  
Baby, if you'll try  
Holding back the tears and mend a broken heart  
Oh blue eyes, don't cry  
Never give you up  
Somewhere there's a friend  
When rain is in your heart  
Babe, don't let it end  
Oh light the flame of love  
Oh, call me just again  
Oh, I'll be there  
Where the rainbow end

Religious Music,Angels Among Us,"I was walking home from school on a cold winter day  
Took a shortcut through the woods, and I lost my way  
It was getting late, and I was scared and alone  
Then a kind old man took my hand and led me home.  
  
Mama couldn't see him  
But he was standing there  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayers.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
When life held troubled times, and had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone there to come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand  
  
And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road  
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope.  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
They wear so many faces  
Show up in the strangest places  
To guide us with their mercy  
In our time of need.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give

Glen Campbell,What A Friend We Have In Jesus,"What a friend we have in Jesus  
All our sins and grieves to bear  
What a privilege to carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Oh, what peace we often forfeit  
Oh, what needless pain we bear  
All because we do not carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Have we trials and temptations?  
Is there trouble anywhere?  
We should never be discouraged  
Take it to the Lord in prayer  
Can we find a friend so faithful  
Who will all our sorrow share?  
Jesus knows our every weakness  
So take it to the Lord in prayer  
Oh, what peace we often forfeit  
Oh, what needless pain we bear  
All because we do not carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Everything to God in prayer

Birds singing in the sycamore tree, ""Dream a little dream of me"".

While I'm alone and blue as can be, dream a little dream of me.  
  
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear.  
Still craving your kiss, I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear.  
Just saying this: Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.  
But in your dreams whatever they be, dream a little dream of me.

The flowers the music of the isles

Marianne Faithfull,Gluttony,"Family  
  
We've gotten word from Philadelphia  
Anna's doing well, she's making lots of money.  
Her contract has been signed to do a solo turn,  
It forbids her ever eating when or what she likes to eat,  
She likes to eat, she likes to eat.  
  
Those are hard terms for little Anna,  
Who has always been very greedy.  
Oh if she does not break her contract!  
There's no market for hippos in Philadelphia!  
  
Every single day they weigh her,  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,  
They have principles to stand by:  
It's a hundred-and-eighteen that were signed for -  
Only for the weight agreed we pay!  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,  
More than that would mean disaster!  
  
But our Anna is not all that stupid  
And she knows a contract is a contract  
So she'll reason: After all  
You still can eat like little Anna  
In Louisiana - Crabmeat! Porkchops!  
Sweet-corn! Chicken!  
And those golden biscuits spread with honey!  
  
Think of our house in Louisiana!  
Look - it's growing! More and more it needs you!  
Therefore curb your craving! Gluttons will be punished!  
Curb your craving, Anna! Gluttons never go to Heaven!

Christmas Songs,If It Doesn't Snow On Christmas,"(Gene Autry)  
  
Santa works all day in his workshop  
Making lots of games and toys  
Then one day, he hops in his sleigh  
To bring them to the girls and boys  
Santa's just as nice as he can be  
There's just one little thing that worries me  
  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh  
In case of rain, will there be a train  
That'll speed him on his way  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How will Santa get around to us  
If he breaks down on his way to town  
Will they let him use a bus  
  
I sent him a nice long letter  
And I hope it's not in vain  
I'd really feel much better

People say he has eight reindeer  
For the sleigh he's driving here  
But how'll he go, if it doesn't snow  
On Christmas this year  
  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh  
In case of rain, will there be a train  
That'll speed him on his way  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How will Santa get around to us  
If he breaks down on his way to town  
Will they let him use a bus  
  
I sent him a nice long letter  
And I hope it's not in vain  
I'd really feel much better  
If I knew he could fly a plane  
  
People say he has eight reindeer  
For the sleigh he's driving here  
But how'll he go, if it doesn't snow

The Jam,HEY MISTER,"Because it's real you think it's a joke  
Because it's on your doorstep you have to have a poke  
At someone  
It's only a cliche because it's all true  
Time after time it happens through and through  
To a new generation  
  
You're just so smug in your elected seat  
You've got your papers sorted out but you can't find your feet  
Well, I'm not surprised  
  
Hey mister with your head in the clouds  
You can't see further than the shillings and pounds  
The things that you say don't mean nothing anymore  
You have no control they've broken down all the doors  
And the only way that you'll fix them up  
Is another war  
  
If you think I'm gonna die in a financial war  
You've got another thing coming and  
And what's more there's lots like me  
  
You juggle lives around with the stroke of a pen  
But we've paid to see that move and now we won't pay again  
The cost is too high  
  
Hey mister your smiles been erased  
You can't understand why we're losing face  
Perhaps it's the promises that you never kept

Falling on you

All you can count on is the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue  
  
No use old girl  
You may as well surrender  
Your hope is getting slender  
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy  
To cheer up little girl blue  
  
When I was very young  
The world was younger than I  
As merry as a carousel  
The circus tent was strung with every star in the sky  
Above the ring I love so well  
Now the young world has grown old  
Gone are the tinsel and gold  
  
All you can count on is the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue

The Bible screamer, the plasma donor  
Buses, car horns, ghetto blasters  
The shouts and cries of the human disasters

Darkness falls on the vast machine  
Where the future stalks the American dream

My head feels light when I'm downtown  
It's all in sight when I'm downtown

And mother in his eyes  
Stumbling through the devil-dark  
With the hound pack in full cry

Are you blind to the winds of change  
Don't you hear him any more

I am never gonna sin again  
Just take these chains from around my legs  
Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend  
  
Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam  
While you lie on a cold damp ground  
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt  
While the wardens hold you down  
  
And you've never seen a friend in years  
Oh it turns your heart to stone  
You jump the walls and the dogs run free  
And the grave's gonna be your home

Before the killing was done his inheritance was mine.

Esau gave his sleeplessness for a piece of moral land.  
Our father favored Esau, he was eager to obey,  
All the wild commandments, the old man shot his way.  
But all this ended when, my brother failed at war,  
He staggered home and found me in the door.  
Esau he's on rollerskates today,  
And he make a statement to someone in L. A.  
Sometimes at night I dream, he's still that hairy man,  
Shadow boxing the apocalypse, wandering the land.  
Esau holds the blessing, brother Esau holds the curse,  
I was thinking that the blame was mine,  
But suspected something worse.  
The more my brother looks like me, the more I understand,

None of us can win.  
Outside that dream, still that hairy man.  
Well sometimes at night I think I understand.

Ellie Goulding,Lights,"I had a way then  
Losing it all on my own  
I had a heart then  
But the queen has been overthrown  
And I'm not sleeping now  
The dark is too hard to beat  
And I'm not keeping up  
The strength I need to push me  
  
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone  
You shine them when I'm alone  
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong  
And dreaming when they're gone  
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home  
Calling, calling, calling home  
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone  
You shine them when I'm alone  
  
Noises, I play within my head  
Touch my own skin  
And hope they'll still be there  
And I think back to when  
My brother and my sister slept  
In another place  
The only time I feel safe  
  
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone  
You shine them when I'm alone  
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong  
And dreaming when they're gone  
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home

Cat Stevens,Just Another Night,"I remember standing here  
Right on this very same site  
I was dying but for you  
It was just another night  
You once rocked me in your world  
You bought me my first shoes  
I was just another lonely child  
Oh and you were much amused  
  
So you took me and you dressed me well  
All for your friends to see  
Drained my body calmly till  
There was no more left in me  
Then you walked out and you cut me cold  
Out on the road somewhere  
Why it happened well I don't know  
And I still have no idea  
  
But everybody needs a friend sometimes  
You need a little help  
And who knows maybe one day you'll seek mine  
Only time will tell  
You once held me in your arms  
You made me feel so right  
I was flying but for you  
It was just another night  
  
But everybody needs a little help  
Whether or not you think you really do  
Everybody needs a little help  
Now the time has come for you  
  
I ain't looking to fight no wars  
No more talking trash  
I'm not seeking any more pain  
Cause I've had enough of that  
But don't you worry it's alright  
If you should come around  
Any night or any day  
I won't ever let you down

Even my own heart don't belong to me.

Got your fire burning in my heart.  
You got me falling like a shooting star,  
Just like some tragic work of art.

Halloween,Trick Or Treat,"By Geof Johnson  
  
The very best part of Halloween  
Is getting more candy than you've ever seen.  
I've got my scariest costume on.  
I scare myself when I'm all alone.  
  
Sun goes down, I'm all dressed up,  
I set out to try my luck.  
Walkin' up and down the street,  
I knock on the door and say...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
  
The very first house is big and dark,...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
  
The very next house is big and white,...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
  
If you go out Halloween night,  
I'll give you a tip that'll make it all right.  
Smile at everyone that you meet.  
Knock on the door and say...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.

Waterboys,Long Way To The Light,"I'm sitting in my bedroom  
Overlooking Findhorn Bay  
Cluny Hill inn the distance  
Summer on the way  
Blue skies and sailing boats  
Like a picture in a book  
I can't believe I got here  
Or how long it took  
Living one step at a time  
Putting one foot in front of the other  
It sure feels right  
Healing on my mind  
Been a long way  
Been a long way to the light  
I'd made it to Manhattan  
Built myself a nest  
I meant to get right back to doing  
Exactly what I do best  
Pluggin' in an electric guitar  
Leading a band  
Well, if you want to give God a laugh  
Tell him your plans!  
Summer in the city  
Wilting in the heat  
Buzzing up and down to Bearsville  
And back to Hudson Street  
I learned meditation  
And how to visualize  
Just breathing, being still  
Never felt more alive!  
Living one step at a time...  
I spent the fall in transit  
Circling the moon  
Like a cat on a hot tin roof  
Like a fiddle without a tune  
I found what I was searching for  
In Mrs Caddy's book  
I had to go there straightaway  
Have myself a look  
I flew back to Scotland  
Anticipation in my bones  
The old country welcoming me  
Like a prodigal coming home  
I knelt and kissed the tarmac  
In the wild Atlantic rain  
Felt the fiery Gaelic blood  
Rising in my veins  
Living one step at a time...  
I spent the night in Glasgow  
Flew to Inverness  
I found the place and at the first  
I was not impressed  
Nobody said hello  
The faces left me cold  
Back then how was I to know  
All that would unfold?  
I entered the Sanctuary  
Heard the voice of a girl  
Sending out a circle of light  
Clear across the world  
I shuddered in the Power  
Like a seedling in a storm  
I've been traveling to this place  
Since the moment I was born  
Flew back to New York City  
Singing the big city blues  
The sand of Findhorn Bay  
Still clingin' to my shoes  
I tried to re-start my life  
But the life I knew was gone  
I had to let go everything  
But that's another song!  
Living one step at a time...  
So I'm sitting in my bedroom  
Overlooking Findhorn Bay  
Cluny Hill in the distance  
Summer on the way  
I'm watching sailing boats  
Bobbing to and fro  
Time to hit the road  
The only way I know...  
Living one step at a time...

Dolly Parton,Green-eyed Boy,"(Dolly Parton)  
I flew off to the wild blue yonder  
'Cause I had a dream  
And I had to go  
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder  
From the love I shared  
With a green-eyed boy  
Lips as sweet as mountain honey  
A body warm as home made wine  
But he had no dreams  
And no means for money  
But he had me just anytime  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Now he was pretty  
With chiseled features  
Like the movie stars in the magazines  
My first love and the son of a preacher  
I fantasized me was James Dean  
But the world outside kept pulling at me  
Offered me fame, respect, and gold  
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion  
Expensive cars, so I chose those  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss  
That green-eyed boy  
Do you think about me  
When the nights are long and cold  
Do you ever miss me  
Do you my green-eyed boy

But first you must indulge me  
And count from one to ten  
Let the game begin

Pin the tail upon the donkey,  
You will surely win  
And if you don't say may I,  
Then I'll pass the cake around  
And I won't give you any,

Or a baby step will do  
But if you don't say may I,  
Then I'll march you out the door  
Where you'll be contemplating  
The numbers one to four  
I hope you're keeping score  
  
'Cause if you don't say may I,  
Then I'll get you with the hose  
And spoil your Sunday clothes  
Will it please you if I tease you  
While you're at the spindry,  
I'll pass the pie around  
But you won't make a sound  
You don't eat blackbird anyhow

Why it can't be wrong

Talking Heads,The Lady Don't Mind,"Last time she jumped out the window,  
Well, she only turned and smiled.  
You might think she would say something,  
But you'd have to wait a while.  
  
Well the lady don't mind.  
No, no, no, the lady don't mind  
She just turns her head and disappears,  
I kinda like that style  
  
Little boat that floats on a river,  
it's drifting through a haze  
She stops by whenever she wants to,  
well, there she goes again  
  
Well, it's no trouble at all.  
No, no, no trouble at all  
Well, what she does  
Is all right with me, and  
I kinda like that style  
  
Come on. come on. I go up and down.  
I like this curious feeling. I know, I see.  
It's like make believe.  
Cover your ears so you can hear what I'm saying.  
I'm not lost but I don't know  
Where I am. I got a question.  
All right. All right.  
This is what we like.  
Who knows, who knows,  
What I'm thinking  
  
She says love is not what she's after,  
And everyone knows.  
Each time she looks in the mirror,  
She lets her feelings show.  
  
Well, the lady don't mind  
No, no, no, the lady don't mind.  
Well, what she says is all right by me,  
And I kinda like that style  
  
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here we go again  
I don't know, I don't know,  
What I'm sayin'.  
Hey man. Hey man.  
I sure don't feel the same  
She likes to say what she's feeling  
Hey. Did I get a big surprise.  
I know you think so.  
Come on. Come on. She says anything.  
Who knows, who knows,  
What she's thinking.

Indigo Girls,I Believe In Love,"When we tried to rework all of this  
Each to her rendition  
Painted ourselves in a corner  
Lost for ideas blindly fishing  
For a compliment or kindness  
Just to bring us into view  
But you could not interpret me and I could not interpret you  
I remember that cold morning when the trees were black with birds  
I tried to make out some connection  
We were at a loss for words  
After all that we've been through  
I could not see giving up  
Despite the picture of our coffee growing colder in the cups  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
And I believe in you and I believe in love  
So we went rolling on down through the years  
Taking time off we could steal  
Until the thief of things unreconciled  
Stuck it's stick into the wheel  
Now we're tumbling in a freefall  
No one's gonna go unscathed  
But it's not because you held back and its not how I behaved  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
I believe in you and I believe in love  
There are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf  
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self  
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands  
So just let it go and see where it lands  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
I believe in you and I believe in love  
I believe in you and I believe in love

Pink Floyd,Opel,"On a distant shore, miles from land  
Stands the ebony totem in ebony sand  
A dream in a mist of gray...  
On a far distant shore...  
  
The pebble that stood alone  
And driftwood lies half buried  
Warm shallow waters sweep shells  
So the cockles shine...  
  
A bare winding carcass, stark  
Shimmers as flies scoop up meat, an empty way...  
Dry tears...  
Crisp flax squeaks tall reeds  
Make a circle of gray in a summer way, around man  
Stood on ground...

But you opened your heart to me  
Underneath all you feel you know  
How deep our love could be  
Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go  
Then I'm leaving it up to you

To the fact that mommy didn't care  
King Jeremy the wicked  
Ruled his world

Clearly I remember  
Pickin' on the boy  
  
Seemed a harmless little fuck  
But we unleashed a lion  
Gnashed his teeth  
  
And bit the recess lady's breast  
How could I forget  
He hit me with a surprise left  
My jaw left hurting  
  
Dropped wide open  
Just like the day  
Like the day I heard  
Daddy didn't give affection  
  
And the boy was something mommy wouldn't wear

Ruled his world

What kind of man have I become?

Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness  
I'm a lonely soldier off to war  
Sent away to die, never quite knowing why  
Sometimes it makes no sense at all  
  
Ten Thousand people look my way  
But they can't see the way that I feel  
Nobody even cares to try  
I spend my life and sell my soul on the road  
And I'm still in the dark  
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone  
  
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness  
I'm a lonely sailor lost at sea  
Drifting with the tide  
Never quite knowing why  
Sometimes it makes no sense at all

(And my heart's on fire)  
I'm dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean

inside  
I saw you turn, i saw you burn today, your flickering, empty eyes hurt me like
pins  
Are you still in, tell me...  
  
I know you've got a sun inside, i know you've got a sun inside...  
I know you've got a sun  
I know you've got a sun  
Inside

Green Day,2000 Light Years Away,"I sit alone in my bedroom  
Staring at the walls  
I've been up all damn night long  
My pulse is speeding  
My love is yearning  
  
[Chorus]  
I hold my breath and close my eyes and  
Dream about her  
'Cause she's two thousand light years away  
She holds my malakite so tight so  
Never let go  
Cause she's two thousand light years away  
Years Away!  
  
I sit outside and watch the sunrise  
Lookout as far as I can  
I can't see her, but in the distance  
I hear some laughter,  
We laugh together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I sit alone in my bedroom  
Staring at the walls  
I've been up all damn night long  
My pulse is speeding  
My love is yearning  
  
I hold my breath and close my eyes and  
Dream about her  
'Cause she's two thousand light years away  
She holds my malakite so tight so  
Never let go  
'Cause she's two thousand light years away

Freddie Aguilar,Minamahal Kita,"Di ko malimutan  
(I can't forget)  
Ang iyong mga larawan

Ang iyong mga pangakong ako lang  
(Your promises that it's only me)  
Kahit nasaan ka man

Ikaw ang siyang tibok n'yaring dibdib

Ikaw at ikaw pa rin

Wala akong ibang iibigin

Lulubog, lilitaw  
Ang buwan at araw

Patuloy pang lalakad ang panahon

Ako'y magmamahal sa 'yo  
(I will keep loving you)  
Hindi ito magbabago

Pag-ibig ko'y laging laan lamang sa 'yo

Minamahal, minamahal kita  
(I love you)  
  
Lagi kong hinahanap  
(I'm always yearning)  
Yakap mong anong sarap  
(For your sweet embrace)  
Ang iyong mga matang nangungusap  
(And your talking eyes)  
'Pag ikaw ay kapiling

Nalilimot ang sarili

Sana'y 'wag nang matapos ang gabi

Turn my life around

It gets me high, up to the sky and when  
I think about Your goodness it makes me want to  
Stomp  
Makes me clap my hands  
  
Makes me want to dance and Stomp

Stomp!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Stomp on the enemy 'cause I've got the victory

Human League,Heart Like A Wheel,"Calling up the promised land  
Johnny Seven's coming over the sea  
He's taking your time  
When you want to be free  
  
Holding out a helping hand  
Are you ready for a real career?  
Will you be so cool  
When it's happening here?  
  
It don't say nothing that I haven't heard  
If what I hear is true  
You won't keep the law with a broken word  
So what are you going to do?  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
Pass the message around the world  
The medium is in retreat  
The power is here  
And packing some heat  
  
Sell your soul to a holy war  
Set the captive free  
We make no promises anymore  
But it isn't fooling me  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
You can't keep the wheels turning anymore  
With anger, blood and fear  
Or make any friends with an M16  
When you blast your way through here  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real

Think I'll stop and fill it up for the ride  
Man said that be twenty dollars

Once in a lullaby.

Behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops

I guess I'll never have  
I'll be working for somebody else  
Until I'm in my grave  
I'll be dreaming of a live of ease  
And mountains Oh mountains o' things  
  
To have a big expensive car  
Drag my furs on the ground  
And have a maid that I can tell  
To bring me anything  
Everyone will look at me with envy and with greed  
I'll revel in their attention  
And mountains Oh mountains o' things

And know what money's worth  
And those whose sole misfortune  
Was having mountains o' nothing at birth  
  
Oh they tell me  
There's still time to save my soul  
They tell me  
Renounce all  
Renounce all those material things you gained by  
Exploiting other human beings  
  
Consume more than you need  
This is the dream  
Make you pauper  
Or make you queen  
I won't die lonely  
I'll have it all prearranged  
A grave that's deep and wide enough  
For me and all my mountains o' things  
  
Mostly I feel lonely  
Good good people are  
Good people are only  
My stepping stones  
It's gonna take all my mountains o' things  
To surround me  
Keep all my enemies away  
Keep my sadness and loneliness at bay  
  
I'll be dreaming, dreaming... Dreaming...

Billy Joel,All About Soul,"She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence  
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain  
And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments  
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain  
  
It's all about soul  
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion  
It's all about soul  
'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion  
She's got to be strong  
'Cause so many things getting out of control  
Should drive her away  
So why does she stay?  
It's all about soul  
  
She turns to me sometimes and asks me what I'm dreaming  
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away  
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me that moment  
And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say  
  
It's all about soul  
It's all about knowing what someone is feeling  
The woman's got soul  
The power of love and the power of healing  
This life isn't fair  
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold  
You've got to be tough, but that ain't enough  
It's all about soul  
  
There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness  
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive  
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires  
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive  
  
It's all about soul  
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow  
It's all about soul  
Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow  
You've got to be hard  
Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n' roll  
But that's only part, you know in your heart  
It's all about soul

No escaping pain  
You belong to me  
Clinging on to life  
By the skin o'my teeth  
  
My blood flows through the streets  
Deluge from the wounds  
Empty jars of sleeping pills  
On the dresser in my room  
My wet brain neighbor cranes  
His neck to see... in time  
The white lights a train  
Bearing down on me

I say a prayer at thanksgiving  
I bless the night and the day  
I look up to the sky with a smile on my face  
And I praise the lord of the new way  
The sweetest sound I ever knew  
Was the sound of reason falling  
Like the summer rain  
And the truth washed the pain away  
New way  
I don't watch tv anymore  
Don't need to see it now we all know the score  
And all the politicians know what they're there for  
It's a new way  
New way

But the wind blew it away

Nobody calls me friend

Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston

Well at least she said she'd be  
I got a home and a big warm bed  
And a feather pillow for my head

Rainbows in the woodland, water to my knees  
Shivering, quivering, the warm breath of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Catbirds and cornfields, daydreams together  
Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes  
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons  
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons  
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Harsh nights and candlelights, woodfires a-blazin'  
Soft lips and fingertips resting in my soul  
Treasuring, remembering, the promise of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses

Cat Stevens,Cats In The Cradle,"Cats in the Cradle  
By Harry Chapin  
  
A child arrived just the other day  
He came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
And he was talking before I knew it and as he grew  
He said, ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm gonna be like you""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Dad, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then,  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
My son turned ten just the other day  
He said ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on lets play  
Can you teach me to throw? "" I said, ""Not today,  
I got a lot to do"" He said ""that's okay""  
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed  
And said ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah  
You know I'm going to be like him""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Dad, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then,  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
Well he came from college just the other day  
So much like a man I just had to say,  
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""  
He shook his head, and he said with a smile  
  
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See you later, can I have them please? ""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Son, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then, Dad  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I said ""Id like to see you if you don't mind""  
He said ""Id love to Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new jobs a hassle, and the kids have the flu.  
But It's sure nice talking to you, Dad,  
It's been sure nice talking to you........ ""  
And as I hung up the phone it had occurred to me  
He'd grown up just like me,  
My boy was just like me..............  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Son, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then, Dad  
We're gonna have a good time then.

When times are their worst

And moments that glow

And one by one the memories stay  
Even when you're close to a dream  
It can still let you down, still let you down  
You'll always have a chance to give up

Rest your weary world in their hands.  
Lay your broken laugh at their feet.

Crapped out  
Yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should I?  
Its all gonna fade  
  
Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage  
One fine day  
But I would not be convicted  
By a jury of my peers  
Still crazy

Still crazy after all these years

Always a thorn in my side and it's not right,  
So complicated we're tired and unpaid tough,  
Tough to admit it, accept it not my day.

The bad things about you  
Oh, no, now  
  
Cause if they're true  
I'll have to get along without you  
Oh, ooh, now  
  
I said the word, the sound  
The song about the things you do  
  
Moving and a grooving  
Using and a fooling  
Chasing around every skirt in town  
If it's true, you'll be on your way  
  
Do I make myself clear

That's got somebody else, oh, no  
Oh, you tell him now, girl, now, now  
  
So if you're running around, baby  
Thinking of putting me down  
You're wrong  
  
Taking away what belongs to me  
Giving to her when I'm in need  
If it's true, you'll be on your way  
  
Do I make myself clear

Something to change it  
Yeah, yeah

The way they claim it, oh, yeah  
Now let me tell you something  
  
All I wanted you to be true, honey  
Love me like you say you do, oh, yeah  
And I won't care for what they say  
Instead, I'll turn my head and walk away  
But if it's true, you know what to do

John Denver,Matthew,"Had an uncle named Matthew  
He was his father's only boy  
Born just South of Cobly, Kansas  
He was his mother's pride and joy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on  
Love is just the way to live and die  
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheat-field  
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky  
  
And all the stories that he told me  
Back when I was just a lad  
All the memories that he gave me  
All the good times that he had  
  
Growin' up a Kansas farmboy  
Life was mostly havin' fun  
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders  
Behind a view beneath the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I guess there were some hard times  
And I'm told some years were lean  
They had a storm in forty-seven  
A twister came and stripped them clean  
  
He lost the farm and lost his family  
He lost the wheat and lost his home  
But he found a family Bible  
Faith as solid as a stone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So he came to live at our house  
And he came to work the land  
He came to ease my Daddy's burden  
And he came to be my friend  
  
So, I wrote this down for Matthew  
And it's for him the song is sung  
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders  
Behind a mule beneath the sun

Went downstairs to eat with my folks  
""Ma...you broke the fuckin egg yolk""  
Punched her in the chest, got on her cheek

Knee to the pussy, kick to the skull

Well the water got to bubbling  
Sky got to rumbling  
And the thunder backed up the choir  
The fish started jumpin'

In a lake of fire  
Then Eddie's momma stepped out of the crowd  
And started yelling out loud

Although the candle hadn't burned down to the stick  
It won't be lit again, the day won't be so bright

All we know is what she left behind  
An apartment cluttered with children's toys,  
Photos of good times  
  
In the bedroom, there's sheets on the windows  
There's a four poster bed for a reason  
There's a box on the floor full of secrets  
It won't be opened  
  
Here older boys and girls would play  
All inhibitions were left behind  
As the door would close, her face begin to shine  
This was her finest hour, this was her finest time  
  
Now, she's gone, and it's not gonna be alright, not for me  
  
She's gone but not forgotten, she's still here  
In all those years she touched so many lives  
Who's gonna watch the little girl she left behind?  
  
Carol Anne stands alone in the school yard  
All the other children have gone  
After waiting for hours,  
She can't understand why her mother left her  
  
In the darkness she sees definition  
In the silence, she hears someone calling  
After nightmares, she lies in bed screaming  
But there's no one listening, there's no one  
Now, she's gone, and it's never gonna be alright not for me she's gone

Marillion,Incommunicado,"I'd be really pleased to meet you if I could remember your name  
But I got problems of the memory ever since I got a winner in the fame game  
I'm a citizen of Legoland travellin' incommunicado  
And I don't give a damn for the Fleet Street aficionados  
But I don't want to be the back-page interview  
I don't want launderette anonymity  
I want my hand prints in the concrete on Sunset Boulevard  
A dummy in Tussauds you'll see  
Incommunicado, incommunicado  
I'm a Marquee veteran, a multimedia bonafide celebrity  
I've got an allergy to Perrier, daylight and responsibility  
I'm a rootin'-tootin' cowboy, the Peter Pan, the street credibility  
Always taking the point with the dawn patrol fraternity  
Sometimes it seems like I've been here before  
When I hear opportunity kicking in my door  
Call it synchronicity call it deja vu  
I just put my faith in destiny - it's the way that I choose  
But I don't want to be a tin can tied  
To the bumper of a wedding limousine  
Or currently residing in the where are they now file  
A toupee on the cabaret scene  
I want to do adverts for American Express cards  
Talk shows on prime time TV  
A villa in France, my own cocktail bar  
And that's where you're gonna find me  
Incommunicado, incommunicado  
Sometimes it seems like I've been here before  
When I hear opportunity kicking in my door  
Call it synchronicity call it deja vu  
I just put my faith in destiny - it's the way that I choose  
Incommunicado, incommunicado  
It's the only way

Ian Hunter,I Am What I Hated When I Was Young,"Well I don't follow any trend  
I don't sulk for hours on end  
I don't wanna reach out 'n' punch someone  
I am what I hated when I was young  
I don't wear designer clothes  
I ain't got pins in my nose  
I ain't got a tattoo on my bum  
I am what I hated when I was young  
  
Poverty was a wonderful thing everyone enjoyed  
We were eatin' grass not smokin' it  
Wasn't like this when I was a boy  
Wasn't like this when I was a boy  
  
I don't rob old people's homes  
I don't steal no cellular phones  
I kinda like my Dad and Mom  
I am what I hated when I was young  
I don't holler, I don't hoot  
I don't act like a nincompoop  
I don't hide when the police come  
I am what I hated when I was young  
  
I'm slowin' down, I'm getting old  
N' my back is getting bad  
I just sit 'n' moan all day  
Wasn't like this when I was a lad  
Wasn't like this when I was a lad  
  
Comb my hair, brush my teeth  
Wash my feet more than once a week  
N' I never leave my flies undone  
I am what I hated when I was young  
I'm the original mixed up kid  
I ain't proud of what I did  
Now I'm older, calmed down some  
I hate what I used to be when I was young  
I hate what I used to be when I was young  
I hate what I used to be when I was young

Phish,Guyute,"Guyute was the ugly pig  
Who walked on me and danced a jig  
That he had learned when he was six  
Then stopped and did some other tricks  
  
Like pulling weapons from his coat  
And holding them against my throat  
He lectured me in a language strange  
And scampered quickly out of range  
  
I'm bouncing like a newborn elf  
I can't remain inside myself  
Guyute glances in my eyes  
And manages to hypnotize  
  
Me as I sleep the sleep of death  
He suck from me my only breath  
That I had breathed since I was ten  
I hope this happens once again

Neil Young,Act Of Love,"The fruit of love was in the future  
Around the corner and over the hill

Slowly pounding  
Slowly pounding  
  
The holy war was slowly building  
Heroes leaving for the great crusade  
Seek reward in the ever after  
Ever after  
Ever after  
  
Don't want to have to lose you baby  
Don't want to have to take you back  
You know I'll never lose you baby  
Abuse you baby  
Use you baby  
  
You know I'll always help you baby  
But I just can't do that  
I know I said I'd help you baby  
Here's my wallet  
Call me sometime

Out Of Eden,Get To Heaven,"I'd say I'm always happy if you want me to  
But sometimes it's not the case  
My life is not as perfect as it seems to be  
It's simply God's amazing grace  
I'm here to finally let you know  
What keeps me hanging on  
What keeps me going strong  
I'm here to share His love with you  
There is no need to fear to live this life of love  
  
[Chorus:]  
With a little faith, with a little love  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it  
With a little help sent from God above  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it through  
  
I know what it takes to be yourself  
Instead of when they put you down  
I can't understand why you choose to hide  
When you should run to the strength I found  
If only you'd see for yourself  
Then you could know the one  
Who loves you so much more  
If only I could help you out  
But God's the only one  
  
What are you waiting for  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
It seems to wash away  
Can't find a will to go on  
But I am here to say there's hope  
You must carry on  
Jesus will light your way  
He'll give you all that you need  
No need to be afraid all you've got to do is believe

It's always the same  
I'm still here waiting  
Praying for you to finally come my way  
  
It's been so long  
Since I've seen your face  
If Santa cared for me at all then you wouldn't be  
So, so far away  
  
Santa isn't listening, no  
And I'm losing hope  
Oh God if it isn't too much  
Please bring my baby home

Maybe this year will be different  
And I won't be, be alone again

Let it snow  
Come on home  
Every Christmas I'll wait  
  
Oh every Christmas  
I turn on all the lights  
And I make a fire so maybe the smoke can clear  
That you're home tonight  
  
But I just don't know (I don't know)  
We'll know deep inside (deep inside)  
I know that you should be here but I feel  
We're running, running out of time  
  
Oh oh every Christmas  
Counting the days  
Maybe this year will be different  
And I won't be, be alone again

Owl City,Beautiful Mystery,"When I'm dressed to the nines, I'm just a shirt and tie  
With a taste for prestige, and beautiful mystery.  
But, clever girls dressed to kill are pretty bittersweet,  
And better-suited for grief than beautiful mystery.  
  
Oh, beautiful mystery.  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
She enjoys it the most, with flowers in her hair.  
Dressin' up like a ghost for beautiful mystery.  
So I kiss her goodnight, and stumble from the room.  
Mighty high on mystique, and beautiful mystery.  
  
Oh, beautiful mystery.  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.

I don't do that much talking these days

About the things that I forgot to do  
And all the times I had the chance to  
  
And I had a lover  
It's so hard to risk another these days  
These days,  
Now if I seem to be afraid  
To live the life I have made in song  
Well it's just that I've been losing so long  
  
I'll keep on moving  
Things are bound to be improving these days  
These days,  
These days I sit on corner stones  
And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend  
Don't confront me with my failures  
I had not forgotten them

Winsheild wipers slappin' time

To the California Sun

Through all kinds of weather,  
Through everything we'd done  
My Bobby, baby, kept me from the cold  
One day a misleading lord  
I let him slip away  
He's looking for that home  
And I hope he finds it  
Well I'd trade enough tomorrows for one single yesterday  
To be holding Bobby's body next to mine

Richard Marx,Superstar,"You're the queen of your own little  
World, you really made a splash  
Got the offers rollin' in but you're  
Nothing more than high paid trash  
Everybody wants to know what goes  
On in your head  
Pity if they found out that you're lonely  
In your bed  
Maybe it all happened to you just a  
Little too fast  
  
Won't let anybody touch you  
So you do it for yourself  
Plain to see there's a woman  
Cryin' out for help  
  
You're a superstar, but  
You don't know who you are  
And your money won't  
Get you very far  
You're a mystery,  
Nothing can set you free  
Your demons haunt you endlessly  
  
You face the end of your youth in a tired  
Little masquerade  
You talk to people with a tongue like a  
Newly sharpened razor blade  
Yours is not a life that lets you take a  
Look inside  
Morals and convictions meet a fate of  
Genocide  
But in the end you'll be sleeping in the  
Bed you made  
  
All you want's a daddy  
The one you never had  
A need for understanding  
Aching in your head  
  
You're a superstar, but you don't know  
Who you are  
And your money won't get you very far  
You're a mystery, it seems so clear to me  
There's something that you'd rather be  
  
Take a look around you now  
Before it's much too late  
Make the choice to change  
Or be a victim of your fate  
All your life you've been  
Running from the girl inside  
  
You're a superstar, but you don't know  
Who you are  
And your fame won't get you very far  
You're a mystery, oh but it's plain to see  
There's someone that you'd rather be

Who can get us hooked?""

Kenny Loggins,The Last Unicorn,"When the last eagle flies, over the last crumbling mountain  
And the last lion roars, at the last dusty fountain  
In the shadow of the forest, though she may be old and worn  
They will stare unbelieving  
At the Last Unicorn  
  
When the first breath of winter, through the flowers is icing  
And you look to the north, and a pale moon is rising  
And it seems like all is dying, and would leave the world to mourn  
In the distance hear her laughter  
It's the Last Unicorn  
I'm alive I'm alive  
  
When the last moon is cast, over the last star of morning  
And the future is past, without even a last desperate warning  
Then look into the sky where through, the clouds a path is formed  
Look and see her how she shimmers, it's the Last Unicorn  
I'm alive I'm alive!

Guided By Voices,Expecting Brainchild,"It isn't quite ready, it's almost 5:30  
Scholars and flunkees  
Faggots and junkies  
Incinerator in a blood red sky  
Kill the head and the body will die  
I can't tell you that I'm happy  
But I can tell you that my clothes are snappy  
It's time to draw the line  
Superman died tonight  
Ate a pound of Kryptonite  
Drank a quart of brotherly love  
Fell straight from the sky above  
And if there's a hell below  
Kenneth Ray ain't gonna go  
He lost his soul in the Korean War  
I lost my concentration when he opened the door  
It's time to draw the line

David Bowie,I Dig Everything,"I've got the village I love - dig everything  
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything - dig everything  
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back  
They don't dig anything - dig everything  
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing - dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Dig  
I feed the lions in trafalgar square and I dig everything - dig everything  
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug  
Everything -dig everything  
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything - dig
everything  
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going  
They don't dig anything - dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Dig  
I've got more friends than I had out for dinners  
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners  
Rick, john, sally, a connection named paul  
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall  
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything  
Dig  
I've made myself at home -dig everything  
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone  
All the movie shows - dig everything  
I sunbathe for love - dig everything  
Even when it's not too hot - dig everything  
'cause I dig everything -dig everything  
Oh yeah

Toto,Carmen,"Last night she ran away  
Left a letter by the telephone  
She didn't take the time to say goodbye  
He knows he has to find her  
Find a way to make her come back home  
She stretched her wings and learned to fly  
  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
  
He calls but there's no answer  
Operator, ring it one more time  
He thinks of her and shuts his eyes  
She wears the ring he gave her  
Something magic, and it once was mine  
Will she be thinking of him tonight?  
  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
  
He has to find her  
I really miss that girl  
He steals into the night  
He'll go mad without her  
I'm so mad about her  
  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care  
Carmen, don't you care for me

Kenny Chesney,Keg In The Closet,"We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard  
He liked sleeping out on top of the car  
He drank beer out of a mason jar  
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed.  
  
A wide frame house in a college town  
A bunch of people always hanging around  
No real problems we needed to drown  
But we tried our best anyway.  
  
We went to class just to pass the time  
Back in '89.  
  
We had a keg in the closet, pizza on the floor  
Left over from the night before  
Where we were going we didn't really care  
We had all we ever wanted  
In that keg in the closet.  
  
This old guitar taught me how to score  
Right there on that Lambda Chi porch  
Mary Ann taught me a little more  
About wantin' what you can't have.  
  
Sweatshirts and flag football  
Spring breaks down in Panama  
For a while we had it all  
We never dreamed it wouldn't last.  
  
We went to class just to pass the time

Left over from the night before  
Where we were going we didn't really care  
We had all we ever wanted  
In that keg in the closet.  
  
We all kind of went our separate ways  
But I swear it seems like yesterday.  
  
Keg in the closet, pizza on the floor  
Left over from the night before  
Where we were going we didn't really care  
We had all we ever wanted

Nat King Cole,Stardust,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
Steals across the meadows of my heart  
High up in the sky the little stars climb  
Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wander down the lane and far away  
Leaving me a song that will not die  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend  
The lonely night dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
But that was long ago  
Now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You are in my arms  
The nightingale tells his fairy tale  
A paradise where roses bloom  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain

So every night I dream (I dream)  
Hope and pray and believe

Another day goes by and I'd lose my mind  
If I didn't know that you were meant for me  
Under moonlit night, when the time is right  
You'll hold me in your arms from then on to infinity  
  
And every night I'll dream (I dream)  
Hope and pray and believe  
So happy that you're mine (I know)

R. Kelly,Intro - The Sermon,"(Well)  
Are you ready for me?  
Before I start, I just wanna get a few things off my chest.  
(Take ya time brother)  
You see, being in the business that I am in, looks like everything I do,  
Everywhere I go, and everything I see,  
Seems to be through some kind of magnifying glass-yes- Can I talk about it?  
(Talk on,talk on)  
While you're looking I suggest you take a good look'  
And I hope you find just what it is you're looking for  
(Amen)  
  
Just like that song says- ain't nobody's business what I do  
Now can I move on?  
(Move on, move on, move on brother Kelly)  
I remember when I was trying to be somebody, but I just didn't know nobody  
(I didn't know nobody)  
But now  
(Now)  
I said now  
(Now)  
Can I say it again?  
(Gon' and say it again)  
Now, every since God has blessed me, it seems that things are going a little  
Bit different(yes it is)  
  
Folks ain't it funny how things can say sometimes,why,even the Statue of  
Liberty want some bump and grind  
Can I getta witness off up in them jeeps (Amen)  
I don't see nothing wrong with a little truth  
Now-now, wait a minute, go that way  
Ya see the good book says that the truth is the light,please, I think it's
time  
To turn on your lights and see the truth  
Can, Can I talk on?  
You don't know where I've been, you don't know where I'm going, You don't know  
What I do.  
  
Can I get a witness?  
So before you go trying to pass judgment on me, pass judgment on yourself,  
Worry bout yourself, and what yourself is doing, and where yourself is going,  
And who yourself has been with  
That way, you  
(you)  
You  
(You)  
You , You don't have to ever worry about nobody  
But Jesus

Mary Black,My Donald,"Oh my Donald he works on the sea  
On the waves that blow wild and free  
He splices the ropes and he sets the sails  
While southward he rolls to the home of the whale  
And he ne'er thinks o' me far behind  
Nor the torments that rage in my mind  
He's mine for only part of the year  
And I'm left all alone with only my tears  
Ye ladies that smell of wild rose  
Think ye for your perfume to where a man goes  
Think ye o' the wives and the babies that yearn  
For a man ne'er returning from hunting the sperm  
My Donald he works on the sea  
On the waves that blow wild and free  
He splices the ropes and sets the sails  
While southward he rolls to the home of the whale

Diana Ross,Lets Make Every Moment Count,"The bittersweet sadness of time passing by  
Trying to hold back the years  
you try to reach out and touch yesterday  
But yesterday just disappears  
  
We've shared a lot of sadness  
We've shared a lot of pain  
Let's make good use of the time that remains  
  
Let's make every moment count  
Let's taste the richness of life to it's fullest amount  
Between me and you and all we've been through  
There are no problems that we can't surmount  
Let's make every moment count  
Let's make every moment count  
  
I still remember the day we first meet  
We both didn't have a care  
The years have flown, but we've both grown  
We're none of the worse for the wear  
  
We're only just beginning  
I'm still your lover and your friend  
And it's never too late to dream again  
  
You say we've seen the best of all our memories  
But if your heart and soul are in it  
We'll make a new one every minute
