Nirvana,Polly,"Polly wants a cracker  
I think I should get off her first  
I think she wants some water  
To put out the blow torch  
  
It isn't me  
We have some seed  
Let me clip  
Your dirty wings  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
I've got some rope  
You have been told  
I promise you  
I have been true  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
  
Polly wants a cracker  
Maybe she would like some food  
She asks me to untie her  
A chase would be nice for a few  
  
It isn't me  
We have some seed  
Let me clip  
Your dirty wings  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
I've got some rope  
You have been told  
I promise you  
I have been true  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
  
Polly said  
  
Polly says her back hurts  
And she's just as bored as me  
She caught me off my guard  
It amazes me, the will of instinct  
  
It isn't me  
We have some seed  
Let me clip  
Your dirty wings  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
I've got some rope  
You have been told  
I promise you  
I have been true  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself

Beautiful South,"You Play Glockenspiel, I'll Play Drums","There's a boy with a brace across his teeth  
White socks, tattooed underneath  
Bus tickets chitched up in his palm  
Stood there he's spinning a yarn  
There's a girl with a plastic pair of shoes  
Two eyes permanently bruised  
Can't find the time to be alarmed  
Just stood spinning a yarn  
Just take your time  
It'll work out fine  
It'll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums  
My name is Derek from the den  
I deal in shillings and in pence  
I'll get you any deal you like  
Ten sweets for a mountain bike you like  
My name is Mandy from the yard  
I deal in crazy tarot cards  
I'll tell you what the future brings  
One cat and a dog that sings  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums  
Just take your time  
It'll work out fine  
It'll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums

Delete me from your friends,  
I don't care what you think,  
Let's forget we ever met,  
Don't cha worry 'bout me,  
  
So I'm sick to my stomach,  
When I'm think about the wasted time we spend togeth,  
Planning on forever,  
(Whatever)  
  
Cheat me once, shame on you,  
Cheat me twice, shame on me  
I'm an idiot,

That beautiful face  
Or these warm or worse days

I could never go back

That you're living in the past  
  
And if you'd ever believe  
I would take you back,  
It took you long to get in  
But now you're out so fast  
  
The way you played your cards  
Shoulda told me who you are  
Always goin' all in  
And you hated when I win  
  
Just had me whipped too far  
I shoulda known from the start  
That you gamble,

Ooooh, there's something better out there  
Ooooh, Hello to the new me  
Ooooh So goodbye baby,

Ray Charles,Carry Me Back To Old Virginny,"Carry me back to old Virginny,  
There's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow,  
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,  
There's where the darkey's heart am longed to go.  
  
There's where I labored so hard for old massa,  
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,  
No place on earth do I love more sincerely,  
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born.  
  
Carry me back to old Virginny,  
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,  
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,  
There's where this old darkies' life am passed away.  
  
Massa and misses, have long gone before me,  
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore.  
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,  
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.  
  
Carry me back to old Virginny,  
There's where the cotton and the corn and tators grow,  
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,  
There's where the old darkies' heart am longed to go.

U2,Fast Cars,"My cell is ringing  
No ID  
I need to know who's calling  
  
My garden's overgrown  
I go out on my belly crawling  
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC  
I got the nightly news  
To get to know the enemy  
  
All I want is a picture of you  
All I want is to get right next to you  
All I want is your face in a locket  
Picture in my pocket  
I take a pill to stop it  
  
I know these fast cars  
Will do me no good  
  
I'm going nowhere  
Where I am it is a lot of fun  
There in the desert to dismantle an atomic bomb  
I watch you shadow box  
Check the stocks  
I'm in detox  
I want the lot of what you've got  
What you've got can make this stop  
  
All I want is a picture of you  
All I want is to get right next to you  
All I want is your picture in a locket  
Your face in my pocket  
Take a pill to stop it  
  
I know these fast cars  
Will do me no good  
  
Child inside  
  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
  
You should worry 'bout the day  
That the pain it goes away  
You know I miss mine sometimes  
  
The size is much too big  
  
There is no fiction  
That will truly fit the situation  
I'm documenting every detail  
Every conversation  
Not used to talkin' to somebody in the body  
Somebody in a body,  
Somebody in a body

Norah Jones,4 Broken Hearts,"Ooh, ooh ooh  
  
People can't be hand-made  
But he keeps slaving away  
At a stone that's too hard to break  
A girl who's too lost to save  
  
So you tried to replace me  
But you didn't get far  
And I tried to repay you  
But I only got scarred  
  
Ooh, ooh ooh  
  
She'll be breaking your fall  
And I'll be building new walls  
But this time I'll have to make sure  
To add a window for you to come back  
  
And we tried to be faithful  
But didn't get far  
Now all we'll be left with is four broken hearts  
I tried to erase you  
But didn't get get far enough away from you  
Because you still can break my heart  
  
Ooh, ooh ooh  
Ooh, ooh ooh  
Ooh, ooh ooh

Johnny Cash,Blistered,"I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot  
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead  
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city  
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed  
  
he's got a whole lotta motion in her sole, I know  
But her sole ain't the place she lets it show  
  
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah  
Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah  
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart  
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go  
  
I've got great big blisters on my fingertips  
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills  
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat  
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills  
  
And ever since she started running around from bar to bar  
I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down  
  
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah  
She done got me, oh yeah  
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart  
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go  
  
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah  
Oh I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

The White Stripes,Party Of Special Things To Do,"When the stiff wind blows  
The flag don't wiggle  
In the party of special things to do  
I met the ace of love  
She took me to her plantation  
For the love without separation  
In the party of special things to do  
It could happen to me  
It could happen to you  
I met the ace of love  
She said I want you to go  
To the party of special things to do  
And when you're through  
I'll be right here waiting for you  
Here take these sparks  
So my distant cousins can get along with you  
Watch out for the mirror man  
And Elixir Sue  
When I got to the party of special things to do  
It wasn't hard to find Elixir Sue  
I met all the cards  
The wild cards  
The one-eye Jill  
The red queen  
She turned her head  
You know what I mean  
She turned it back and said  
""I got a brand new game I want to lay on you""  
I met them all  
At the party of special things to do  
When I was done  
I was far from through  
I returned to the ace of love  
Now wouldn't you?  
I met them all  
The camel wore a nightie  
The camel wore a nightie  
At the party of special things to do  
Elixir Sue  
It wasn't hard to find liquor at the do  
I met all the cards  
The wild cards  
You know what I mean  
Then she turned it back and said  
""I got a brand new game I think I want to lay on you""  
I met elixir Sue  
At the party of special things to do  
It's so special

Marianne Faithfull,Ghost Dance,"What is it children that falls from the sky?  
Tayi, taya, tayi, aye ya.  
Mannah from Heaven from most high,  
Food from the Father, tayi, taye ya.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the grief.  
  
Peace to your brother, give and take heed,

One foot extended, snake to the ground,  
Wave of the Earth, one turn around.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again,shake out the grief, babe.  
  
Stretch out your arms now dip and sway,  
Fruit of thy bird, tayi, taya.  
Threw off your shoe, haul off the sow,  
Dust off the words that shape from the tale.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.

Bread of your bread, host of your host.  
We are the tears that fall from your eyes,  
Word of your word, cry of your cry.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again.  
We shall live again, we shall live.  
  
What is it, Father, in your eye,  
What is this grave sign, eyes to cry.  
Blood of my baby, well, just what I need.  
What is it, hide me, way off to speed.  
  
Who is it, Father, holy that night?  
What is it, Father, that moves to the right?  
What is it, Father, isn't it pain?  
What is it, Father, that shapes from your main?  
  
What is it, Father, supposed to be brave?  
A lot of questions, the right to live  
What is it, baby, I can't do.  
Your mama loves you, I'm dying, too.  
  
I won't forget you, never lie  
I'll always love you till I die

Through another day  
Watching my dreams  
Turn into ashes  
And my hopes  
Into bits of clay  
Once I could see  
Once I could feel

Oh without a goal  
Stripped of my heart  
And my soul  
What now, my love  
Now that it's over

Closing in on me  
Here come the stars  
Tumbling around me  
And there's the sky  
Where the sea should be  
What now, my love  
Now that you're gone  
I'd be a fool  
To go on and on  
No one would care  
No one would cry  
If I should live  
If I should die  
What now, my love  
Now there is nothing  
Only my last goodbye  
Only my last  
My last goodbye

I saw violence in the moon  
Two broken lovers strong and strewn,  
I drank myself into a dream:  
  
Tijuana moon,  
My daddy Tijuana moon,  
Oh my darlin',  
Tijuana moon Lord my daddy  
Tijuana moon  
  
You can keep the Texas blues,  
Tequila and the burning stone,  
But my amigo  
Nothin's good against the Tijuana moon  
  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon  
Talk about lovin' Tijuana moon  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon

David Bowie,Almost Grown,"Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school  
They ain't said I broke no rule  
I ain't never been in Dutch  
I don't browse around too much  
Don't bother me, leave me alone  
Anyway I'm almost grown  
I don't run around with no mob  
Got myself a little job  
I'm gonna buy me a little car  
Drive my girl in the park  
Got my eye on a little girl  
Ah, she's really out of this world  
When I take her to the dance  
She's got to talk about romance  
You know I'm still livin' in town  
But I done married and settled down  
Now I really have a ball  
So I don't browse around at all

James Taylor,Riding On A Railroad,"We are riding on a railroad, singing some else's song  
Forever standing by the cross road.  
Take a side and step along.  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea.  
Maybe you an me can meet again.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing someone else's song  
Sing along.  
Time to time I tire of the life that I've been leading  
Town to town, day by day  
There's a man up here who claims to have his hands upon the reins.  
There are chains upon his hands and he's riding upon a train.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing some else's song  
Forever standing by the cross road.  
Take a side and step along.  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea.  
Maybe you an me can meet again.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing someone else's song.

Perry Como,Just One Way To Say I Love You,"I love you, I love you, there's no other way  
Just one way to say ""I love you""  
I love you, I love you, and, try as I may  
That's all I can say - ""I love you""  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you, I love you, and yearn for the day  
The day when you'll say ""I love you""  
  
There's no other way  
Just one way to say ""I love you""

Dream Theater,Lines In The Sand,"Sometimes  
For a moment of bliss  
In the passion  
We're craving  
There's a message we miss  
  
Sometimes when  
The spirit's left alone  
We must believe in something  
To find if we've grown  
  
Tragic reflex  
Shattered calm  
Static progress  
Senses gone  
Numb awareness

If you're perfectly still  
You can hear the virgin weeping  
For the savior of your will  
  
Sometimes  
Your castles in the air  
And the fantasies you're seeking  
Are the crosses you bear  
  
Sacred conflict  
Blessed prize  
Weeping crosses  
Stainless eyes  
Desperate addict

We fabricate our demons  
Invite them into our homes  
Have supper with the aliens  
And fight the war alone  
We conjure up our skeletons  
Enlist the den of thieves  
Frightened from our closets  
Then sewn upon our sleeves  
  
In the stream of consciousness  
There is a river crying  
Living comes much easier  
Once we admit  
We're dying  
  
Sometimes  
In the wreckage of our wake  
There's a bitterness we harbor  
And hate for hatred's sake  
  
Sometimes  
We dig an early grave  
And crucify our instincts  
For the hope we couldn't save  
  
Sometimes  
A view from sinless eyes  
Centers our perspective  
And pacifies our cries  
  
Sometimes  
The anguish we survive  
And the mysteries we nurture  
Are the fabrics of our lives  
  
Swept away with the tide

Electric Light Orchestra,Need Her Love,"She gives me love that I could never hope to have,  
She tells me that she needs me,she tells me that she's glad,  
And if she goes away, I'm like someone who's left out in the rain,  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
She came in from the west, a summer breeze I couldn't rest,  
I had to take a fast train, to be there by her side,  
She made me feel so good, she made it like it should be all the time  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
Just when I was thinkin' of her, she came along and made me  
want her. I need her love, I need her love, I need her love.  
  
If she goes away, I'm like someone who's left out in the rain,  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
The boats that sail, the planes that fly,she is with me.  
I wonder if she wonders, if this is all for real,  
I couldn't stand to see her cry because of me, that would be sad.  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
She tells me everything, she makes me smile, she tries to sing,  
But never shares her suffering, if things are going wrong,  
She makes it like a dream, if things are as they seem the  
world is good. I need her love, I need her love, I need her love.

I saw it in her eyes  
She'd be gone before the evening  
  
So I poured another strong one  
And chopped a line from here to Texas  
'Cause I've lost another good one  
She's on the midnight train to Memphis  
  
With a brand new start  
I swore I'd love from the heart  
I meant to change my ways  
But I've seen better days  
  
Than the one that's here this morning, mmhm  
With a wife and kids at home  
With a job somewhere on some assembly line  
I wish I had that life  
I bet you wish you had mine

I'm improving the conditions of the rap industry  
The beat will expand, to land on foreign lands  
Germany, Italy, France and Japan, it'll  
Give you a lift, no need to sniff  
No butts no how's no why's or if's  
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated  
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it  
Wrapped by a power, a musical shower-shower  
A picture-picture of me-of me on the Eiffel-Eiffel Tower-Tower  
I need a beat-beat  
  
Doing-doing dirty, I'm your-your thought  
You're bein'-being taken-taken, the musical boom  
I'm in full treating your eardrums  
Increasing the rate of vibration  
I wanna rock ya-rock ya, that's all you need to know-know  
I need a beat, is the title of the show-show  
Providing-providing pleasure on the musical measures  
All-all arranged, to alleviate pressure  
I'm up on your list, your party thera-therapist  
Beat programmer and lyri-lyricist  
Ladies Love Cool James, studio user  
A million or more screaming people abuser  
I predict, this jam will hit  
The highest plateau in the world of music  
Paparazzi, wealth and fame  
The total propulsion, of my name  
  
I need a beat  
  
Computer wise, and the engineer's eyes  
Have to be very acute, education level high  
The product is mine, beat on the rhyme  
The control was part of the studio design  
Track after track, culminating on wax  
The tape has slack, rewind then back  
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel  
A perfect place for MC's to duel  
  
I need a beat, Farmer's Boulevard  
Ha ha, Queens! Ladies Love Cool James!  
Cut Creator!

Venom,Satanachist,"I preach the ways of Satan  
Answer to his calls  
I translate manuscripts  
On ancient Latin scrolls  
In my shrine, my avernus  
I see the gates of Hell  
Guarded well by Chronozon  
Tortured souls do dwell  
Satanachist  
Satanachist  
I mount the virgin Venus  
Plague the blackened seas  
I am the souls destructor  
Marching without fear  
The night is filled with souls  
In coral exctasy  
The saraband of death  
Will always follow me  
Satanachist  
Satanachist  
I bear the evil eye  
Possess the unbidden  
I'll bring your dead alive  
And chew your flesh from bone  
I stalk through life and death  
With Gorgon for my gaze  
I breath the immortal pain  
Beware the human race

Amy Grant,It's A Miracle,"It must have happened sometime in the night  
No one saw the stone be rolled away  
When the grave saw morning light  
The skeptics and friends all had to say  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
My soul is like a tomb in constant night  
Till one day the stone was rolled away  
Then my heart saw morning light  
And no one alive can explain it away  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
Now, now won't you see  
What I'm trying to say?  
If you believe, it could happen today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
It's a miracle, what a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, what a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away

You know it's really a miracle  
A miracle, a miracle

You know it's really a miracle

Michael W. Smith,Let It Rain,"Let it rain, let it rain.  
Open the floodgates of heaven  
Repeat  
  
The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad  
Let the distance shores rejoice  
Clouds and thick darkness surround Him  
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne  
A fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side  
His lightning lights up the world  
The earth sees and trembles  
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord  
Before the Lord of all the earth  
The heavens proclaim His righteousness  
And all peoples will see His glory  
  
We want to see Your glory, God!  
Do you want to see His glory?  
Lift your voices, lift your hands!  
  
Let it rain, let it rain.  
Open the floodgates of heaven  
Let it rain, let it rain.  
Open the floodgates of heaven

America,What Does It Matter,"(Great hits of the sixties)  
Look the lady's got a photograph  
Silver framed and velvet backed  
Well, she took it quite a while ago  
Funny that she never let me know  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesn't show  
I just don't know  
It's only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh, oh, oh  
And now she's wearing satin shoes  
Gilded hair to pay the dues  
I guess that I should tip my hat  
I wonder if she'd think of looking back  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesn't show  
I just don't know  
It's only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh, oh  
In the parking lot late at night  
Paper straws never worked out right  
I knew I wanted to  
But didn't know why  
So I just said ""Hi""  
(Everybody sing along now)

Bee Gees,Don't Throw It All Away,"Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why  
But lately you don't talk to me  
Darling I can't see me in your eyes  
I hold you near but you're so far away  
And it's losing you I can't believe  
To watch you leave and let this feeling die  
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive  
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love  
You know I can't survive  
Only my love can raise you high above it all  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
(break)  
  
We can take the darkness and make if full of light  
But let your love flow back to me  
How can you leave and let this feeling die  
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone  
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on  
No other women's love could be as true, I'm begging you  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
We changed the world we made it ours to hold  
But dreams are made for those who really try  
This losing you is real  
But I still feel you here inside  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love

Joni Mitchell,Turbulent Indigo,"You want to make Van Goghs  
Raise 'em up like sheep  
Make 'em out of Eskimos  
And women if you please  
Make 'em nice and normal  
Make 'em nice and neat  
You see him with his shotgun there?  
Bloodied in the wheat?  
Oh what do you know about  
Living in Turbulent Indigo?  
  
Brash fields, crude crows  
In a scary sky  
In a golden frame  
Roped off  
Tourists guided by  
Tourists talking about the madhouse  
Talking about the ear  
The madman hangs in fancy homes  
They wouldn't let him near!  
He'd piss in their fireplace!  
He'd drag them through Turbulent Indigo  
  
""I'm a burning hearth,"" he said  
""People see the smoke  
But no one comes to warm themselves  
Sloughing off a coat  
And all my little landscapes  
All my yellow afternoons  
Stack up around this vacancy  
Like dirty cups and spoons  
No mercy Sweet Jesus!  
No mercy from Turbulent Indigo.""

Look at that Ganja covered with oil  
Using my tweezers, Got pot in the freezer  
Made a new pipe out of aluminium foil  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
(On a rope On a rope On a rope)  
Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
Don't know the reason, Satyed here all season  
Maybe that Tye-stick was a way bit too strong  
But I got a real beauty, A columbian doobie  
And soon I'll be up on my way along  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope

Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
I blew out my bong pipe, Ran out of budlight  
But I found some stash I had hidden at home  
Put it into a blender, And soon it will render  
These little fudge brownies that help me get stoned

Hillsong,I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever,"[Intro:]  
Over the mountains and the sea  
Your river runs with love for me  
And I will open up my heart  
And let the Healer set me free  
I'm happy to be in the truth  
And I will daily lift my hands  
For I will always sing of  
Of when Your love came down  
  
[Chorus:]  
I could sing of Your love forever (x4)  
  
[Bridge:]  
Oh I feel like dancing  
It's foolishness I know  
But when the world has seen the light  
They will dance with joy  
Like we're dancing now  
  
I could sing of your love forever (5x)

Conway Twitty,Goodbye Time,"Goodbye Time  
It's your life  
You say you need a change  
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true  
  
Mean anything  
You say it's different now  
And you keep staring at the door  
How can you walk away  
Don't I matter anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
If being free  
Is worth what you leave behind  
And if it's too late  
For love to change your mind  
Then it's goodbye time  
  
If we had known  
Our love would come to this  
We could have saved our hearts  
The hurt of wasted years  
  
Well it's been fun  
What else can I say  
If the feeling's gone  
Words won't stop you anyway

And she's been sitting in the lobby since nine  
  
She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves

And time can move so slow  
When you're all dressed up

Leaving with their families  
The nurse tells her, it's time to come to dinner  
She says she's expecting company  
They're just running late  
But, the nurse knows the truth too well  
She just sighs and walks away

Yusuf Islam,I Think I See The Light,"I used to trust nobody  
Trusting even less their words  
Until I found somebody  
There was no one I preferred  
  
My heart was made of stone  
My eyes saw only misty gray  
Until you came into my life  
I saw everyone that way  
  
Until I found the one  
I needed at my side  
I think I would have been  
A blind man all my life  
  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
  
I used to walk alone  
Every step seemed the same  
This world was not my home  
So there was nothing much to gain  
  
Look up and see the clouds  
Look down and see the cold floor  
Until you came into my life  
I saw nothing, nothing more  
  
Until I found the one  
I needed at my side  
I think I would have been  
A blind man all my life  
  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
(Shine, shine, shine)  
I think I see the light  
(Shine, shine, shine)  
  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
So shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
  
I think I see the light  
Coming to me, coming through me  
Giving me a second sight  
  
So shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
  
Shine, shine, shine  
(I think I see the light)  
Shine, shine, shine

Shine, shine, shine

A smoking gun  
Frozen wasteland we are on  
I see the lights  
Flames ignite  
Cigarettes that I don't own  
I've seen them bleed  
Watched them beg  
Walked to where the sidewalk ends  
Recycled bars, brand new cars  
Better find that cabby quick

Dim the lights  
The city ignites  
Silent boycott of our lives  
We are the town  
The time is now  
Got one chance to paint it red  
  
Every night, start a fight  
Find a count to make it right  
Take a shot, make it grip  
Gonna shoot one from the hip  
  
Drinks for free when you're with me  
If you're down with me  
Then you must believe  
  
Believe  
That you're always on my mind

Don't ask me for a reason, I can't explain  
Why we hurt one another again and again  
As I lie bleeding here I still

And I just can't watch it slipping away  
And I just can't let it go  
And I just can't stand another minute  
  
Maybe now someday our shattered live  
Will mend themselves again  
But now a million miles away

Why we hurt one another again and again

Sting,A Thousand Years,"A thousand years, a thousand more  
A thousand times a million doors to eternity  
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times  
An endless turning stairway climbs  
To a tower of souls  
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,  
The towers rise to numberless floors in space  
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,  
A million names but only one truth to face  
A million roads, a million fears  
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty  
I could speak a million lies, a million songs,  
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time  
But if there was a single truth, a single light  
A single thought, a singular touch of grace  
Then following this single point, this single flame,  
This single haunted memory of your face  
I still love you  
I still want you  
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves  
Like galaxies in my head  
I may be numberless, I may be innocent  
I may know many things, I may be ignorant  
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands  
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands  
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times  
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes  
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief  
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief  
I still love you  
I still want you  
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves  
Like galaxies in my head  
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves  
Eternities still unsaid  
'Til you love me

Alison Krauss,This Time The Dream's On Me,"Somewhere, someday we'll be close together  
Wait and see  
Oh, by the way  
This time the dream's on me  
  
You'll take my hand  
And you'll look at me adoringly  
But as things stand  
This time the dream's on me

It would be fun  
To be certain that I'm the one  
To know that I, at least  
Supply the shoulder you cry upon  
  
To see you through  
Till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true but  
This time the dream's on me

To see you through  
Till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true but

Proclaimers,When You're In Love,"When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind  
  
Seeing things like your heart with wings  
Then you hear violin strings playing  
Feel all the things that you feel you should  
You would lie, you would kill, you would die  
At least that's what you're saying  
The worst thing is that you really would  
  
When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind  
  
Six thousand million people in the world  
And you say there's just one  
The only one, and you must be together  
And if they love you the pain is so sweet  
And it just gets better and better  
And if they don't  
You want them more than ever  
  
When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind

Barbra Streisand,A Taste Of Honey,"Cold winds may blow o'er the icy sea  
But I'll take with me  
The warmth of thee  
A taste of honey,  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
He will return...he will return  
He'll come back  
For the honey and me  
I leave behind  
My heart to wear  
And may it e'er remind you of  
A taste of honey  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
He will return...he will return...  
He'll come back for the honey and me.

The Jam,To Be Someone,"To be someone must be a wonderful thing  
A famous footballer a rock singer  
Or a big film star, yes I think I would like that  
To be rich and have lots of fans  
Have lots of girls to prove that I'm a man  
And be no. 1 - and liked by everyone  
  
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends  
They really dig me and I dig them  
And the bread I spend - is like my fame - its quickly diminished  
  
And there's no more swimming in a guitar shaped pool  
No more reporters at my beck and call  
No more cocaine its only ground chalk  
No more taxis now well have to walk  
  
But didn't we have a nice time -  
didn't we have a nice time  
Oh wasn't it such a fine time  
  
I realize I should have stuck to my guns  
Instead shit out to be one of the bastard sons  
And lose myself - I know it was wrong - but its cost me a lot  
  
And there's no more drinking after the club shuts down,  
I'm out on me arse with the rest of the clowns  
Its really frightening without a bodyguard  
So I stay confined to my lonely room

Oasis,Underneath The Sky,"Underneath the sky of red  
Is a storyteller sleeping alone  
He has no face and he has no name  
And his whereabouts are sort of unknown  
  
All he needs is his life in a suitcase  
It belongs to a friend of a friend's  
And as we drink to ourselves  
We'll amuse ourselves  
Underneath the sky  
Underneath the sky again  
Underneath the sky again  
  
So wish me away to an unknown place  
Am I living in a land with no name  
I'll be making a start with my brand new heart  
Stop me making sense once again  
  
All we need is our lives in a suitcase  
They belong to a friend of a friend's  
And as we drink to ourselves  
We'll amuse ourselves

Uriah Heep,Mistress Of All Time,"(enlightened woman)  
She dances on the seven seas  
Dances on the ocean  
Sunlight on her golden hair  
Shapes of pure emotion  
Her voice is heard like  
Crystal words across the sky  
She moves just like an angel  
She's the mistress of all time  
Her sun pours down like liquid gold  
To chase away the sorrows  
Her clothes are like a million stars  
Made of tears and rainbows  
And all the while  
Her senses smile into my life  
She moves just like an angel  
She's a mistress of all time  
Just like the restless  
To a mission bell  
I must run to her  
Meet her everywhere  
As her music fills the universe  
She leaves the dancing visions  
Of her image on the water  
And precious stones upon the shore  
From every distant corner  
Like diamonds in the light  
They shine beyond the stars  
She moves just like an angel  
She's the mistress of all time  
She dances on the seven seas  
Dances on the ocean  
Sunlight on her golden hair  
Shapes of pure emotion  
Her voice is heard like  
Crystal words across the sky  
She moves me like an angel  
She's the mistress of all time  
She moves me like an angel  
A voice of pure emotion  
Her tears are like a rainbow

But I do believe in Christmas  
  
Walking through a winter dreamland  
Sleighbells ringing and my friends by my side

The reindeer is singing our favourite song  
And Santa's coming to our party  
Dancing all night long  
  
Cause I believe in Christmas  
I believe in dreams come true  
When it's cold outside  
I close my eyes  
And it's magic through and through  
I believe in Christmas  
I believe in Santa's gifts

The angels sing  
And Christmas time is here  
For you and for me  
  
The stars are shining oh so brightly  
The snowman's hopping and bopping with me  
Lots of joy for everybody  
Under the Christmas tree  
Everyone is so excited  
You know it's just how I want it to be  
I'm hoping that all my wishful thinking  
Will be reality

Life to day moves with the tide  
Stormy seas, harbor of light

Run away with any so-and-so

Slayer,Temptation,"Have you ever felt the need  
To see more than you can see  
Look into uncertainty  
Reflections of treachery  
Would you leave the world behind  
Endless life is here to find  
Can I interest you in lies  
Sell your soul for all it buys

Play with your insanity  
Shatter your reality  
Pulsing in your blood  
  
I can satisfy your greed  
For now all your debts are free  
I have all eternity  
To quench all the death I breed  
Recreate the rules of play  
From now things are done my way  
None have ever won my game  
Crucified them all in flames  
  
Have you ever danced with the devil  
His temptation ever summoned you  
Ever penned your name in blood  
Let possession slowly swallow you  
When you stand under full moonlight  
The attraction mesmerizes you  
Have you ever wondered why  
It seems that evil you're attracted to  
  
Reach out to my hand  
Step back in time's sand  
Genetic wasteland  
Far beyond death

Olivia Newton-John,I Never Did Sing You A Love Song,"(Nichtern)  
I never did sing you a love song  
I only sang phrases in time  
I never did write you a sonnet  
I just laid my WORDS down in rhymes  
Up and down the river, so many boats to ride  
Yet precious few deliver the goods that we need to survive  
I never spoke falsely or crossly  
I never put tears in your eyes  
And you never shattered my lonely heart  
You never deceived me with lies  
And yet somehow I seem to recall I STIRRED in my sleep for a while  
Dreaming of a river man exchanging my life for a smile

But it doesn't stay

Spent them fast enough

They don't last with just one man  
But baby grand  
Will stand by me  
  
They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio  
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone  
But only songs like these  
Played in minor keys  
Keep those memories holding on  
  
I've come far  
From the life I've strayed in  
I've got scars  
From those dives I've played in  
Now I'm home  
And I'm weary  
In my bones  
Every dreary one night stand  
But baby grand  
Came home with me  
  
Ever since this gig began  
My baby grand's  
Been good to me

And it's a shame  
That you're so afraid  
Just a worker waiting  
In the pouring rain  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Of a broken, of a broken dream
